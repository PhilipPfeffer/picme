"For me December with Christmas coming up is a special month of cozyness and gathering with family and friends, lots of food and gl√∂gg. I just fell in love with the beautiful ‚ÄòThe Christmas Tablecloth‚Äô from @georgjensendamask with the iconic braided hearts in the new colour winter grey which is harmonious edition with it‚Äôs muted grey tones. With a minimalistic approach to my lifestyle aesthetic, warm atmosphere and cozyness is very important to me. I‚Äôve always focus on design, materials, craftsmanship and tactility when creating a space in my home. So my Christmas table is Scandinavian minimalistic decorated with branches picked from the nature. Have a lovely 2 Sunday in advent dear dudes!

"Weekends are for long and slow breakfasts. I love to set my table with the beautiful porcelain ‚ÄòJulemorgen‚Äô (Christmas morning) from the Norwegian @wikwalsoe. During the weekends I put some more effort into the tablesetting with a lighted candle and decorate with some branches picked in the nature. I love the poetic yet minimalistic details on this collection which makes the Christmas table even more festive and elegant. Have a lovely Saturday dear dudes!

The lamp gives the room a calm atmosphere with it‚Äôs soft diffused lightning. It‚Äôs just like a piece of art in the room with all it‚Äôs impaccable  details in brushed brass and mouth-blown amber coloured glass. It‚Äôs a Limited Edition and only awailable from October 1st until December 31rd 2019. Have a lovely day dear dudes!

"Sweet December has arrived and I‚Äôm slowly getting into the Christmas spirit. It‚Äôs a busy month so after work I love to spend some relaxing time in the sculptural and iconic Pantonova seating module from @montanafurniture in this cozy corner.

"It has been so cold outside lately. So I feel happy to sleep on my beautiful signature Aiayu pyjamas in the new Seersucker quality in the colour Shell from @aiayu (kindly gifted). It feels so comfortable, soft on my skin and keeps me warm during the cold winter nights. For me a good nights sleep begins with high quality materials and air dried cloth. Seersucker is a thin puckens fabric 100% organic cotton in a smooth wowen texture given the pyjamas a crickled yet luxury look. The pyjamas is part on their new AIAYU DOMUS homewear collection launched earlier this year.

"We set our plans for the year ahead, we‚Äôve got our months mapped out and our weekly targets and goals in front of us.
-
What happens when things just don‚Äôt work out?
Won‚Äôt ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs meant to be‚Äô kinda just sort itself out anyway?
Where do our actions come into God‚Äôs plans?
-
I have always struggled with this.
I‚Äôve been a planner, a goal setter, a schedule maker and the leader of the ‚Äòonly dead fish go with the flow‚Äô club.
-
If we want something to happen, we‚Äôve got to plan the hell out of our future and set dates, targets and goals for every accomplishment! Right?
-
What happens when your fool-proof plan to get married at 24 falls flat on it‚Äôs face and you‚Äôre single at 35?!
-
Maybe you were meant to have a million bucks in your bank account by the end of 2019 and you‚Äôre only about a million off a couple of weeks out üí∏
-
When our perfectly thought out plans don‚Äôt end up like we wanted them to, we can easily fall into the trap of becoming down-cast, feeling we‚Äôre not worthy of our dreams or aren‚Äôt good enough to see them come true.
-
Keep your heads up! It‚Äôs the dreams that haven‚Äôt eventuated that can actually bring the greatest blessing. How many times have you looked back and been grateful your prayers haven‚Äôt been answered (hindsight is a beautiful thing!)
-
Your plans haven‚Äôt come to pass because you needed to be in this very situation you‚Äôre in right now. This moment in time sets you up for your future. There is something you need to learn and equip yourself with for the season ahead.
-
We want our precious plans to work out.
God wants our trust to be in Him and his plans.
-
Because, whether we like it or not, He has the best plans for us and is guiding each and every step of the way.
-
Set goals, create plans and use what you‚Äôve been given to the very best of your ability.
-
Then throughout the journey trust God and his perfect path and timing.
-
You‚Äôre meant to be exactly where you are right now.
-
Keep those dreams alive and achieve your impossible while trusting the journey you‚Äôre on and the one who‚Äôs guiding you through it.

Absolutely, be aware of the path ahead, planning our journey and creating a roadmap to chart our course for the year ahead.

In the face of the unknown, MOVE FORWARD.

"FROM COMFORT TO CALLING
Feeling comfortable is great. Knowing exactly what you‚Äôre doing, where you‚Äôre going and how to get there.
-
6 years ago, I remember telling someone how comfortable I was in my Teaching job. I knew what I was doing, I knew I was good at it, I was passionate about it and I worked alongside amazing people.
-
This comfort was destroyed when Mum and Dad sat me down in the lounge room in late Nov 2013 and told me Dad had just been diagnosed with terminal Pancreatic Cancer and was given just a few months left to live.
-
My dreams of setting Mum and Dad up with a beautiful property to retire on had burst like a balloon.
-
My comfortable lifestyle was the thing that had kept me from pursuing my ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô dreams.
-
We can become comfortable in our jobs, our relationships, our finances, our purpose, our roles and responsibilities as well as our contribution to the world around us.
-
Sometimes God will destroy that comfort to encourage us to step into our calling. This can seem harsh, unfair and unjust.
-
But it‚Äôs often that little push you need to obey your hearts desires and start to pursue your purpose and true calling.
-
For me, pursuing my purpose outworked itself in starting an Instagram account called @achievetheimpossible.
-
Today, I have the blessing and honour to have a platform that inspires and encourages millions of people around the world every single week to achieve their own impossible and pursue their calling.
-
The ‚Äò2020 VISION‚Äô event I‚Äôm involved in this weekend at the beautiful @ritzcarltonkapalua with @msrielly and @liveyourstandard is an example of this.
-
When you‚Äôre brave enough to step out of the comfortable, God can work through you to enable your calling.
-
Be grateful in the seasons of discomfort. God is using them to stretch and grow your capacity to be able to become the person your dreams need you to be.

"‚ÄúAs a runner, you typically have a few pairs of shoes you‚Äôre rotating through. You may need a different shoe for long runs, another shoe for speed. We might run through a pair in a month and a half. So ideally, you‚Äôd have different types that meet different needs, but each pair would be recyclable. A shoe like this could mean that I‚Äôm not chucking 10 pairs of shoes in landfill every year.‚Äù ‚Å£

"‚ÄúJust 5 to 10 years ago, if you owned more than 20 pairs of shoes you were whack. You had a problem. Then it was normal to own 20, then 50, then 100 plus. We have to change our thinking to the opposite. Let‚Äôs give back the shoes instead of keeping them in the closet. I think we‚Äôre still quite far off from that sort of thinking being widely accepted, but the shift will happen fast if the whole industry backs into it.‚Äù¬†‚Å£

"‚ÄúWhen I first heard about [FUTURECRAFT.LOOP] I was skeptical. There‚Äôs a lot of greenwashing around, and I like to dig deeper. GEN 1 is 100% recyclable and although there‚Äôs no waste created, GEN 2 still means adding virgin plastic into the stream, which isn‚Äôt going to work in the long run. My question is - at what stage do we reach 1:1 recyclability? That being said, I do think it‚Äôs really important that big companies invest in this kind of innovation. This generation of the shoe might not offer the complete solution yet, but it could get us there. I have my fingers crossed for the future.‚Äù ‚Å£

"I love this time of year, because we get to share special moments with family and friends. But what makes it even more special, is that it‚Äôs a reminder to give back.

We try to make dinner together as a family...in hopes that someday our kids will take over #ad. Which is why we try to instill good eating habits and an honest awareness for what‚Äôs inside their food. Thanks, @lightlifefoods for making honesty a part of your message while you make honestly good plant-based burgers. What are some of the most honest conversations you‚Äôve had with your kids? Share with us using #ATasteOfHonesty
üòä
The holidays are in full force now and the kids have been incredibly excited to relax and enjoy the warm glow that only a beautifully lit christmas tree can provide #ad. So much so that they‚Äôve eagerly been awaiting the days that they can fall asleep to holiday movies under that very glow. Thanks to #CasetaSmartLighting by @lutronelectronics smart light switches and plugs we‚Äôre able to let all of this naturally happen while having the option to turn off the tree without risk of awakening a deep slumber.  #SwitchToCaseta
#ad The holidays are upon us and instead of burning holes in our wallets, we've learned a few things over the years. We're able to pinch pennies by grabbing next year's holiday decorations at end of season sales. Also, with all of the credit card usage during the season, we have a bit more peace of mind knowing that since @creditkarma is helping us monitor our credit, we're also able to easily spot potential fraud across our credit accounts.
I‚Äôve been reminiscing over older photos since I‚Äôm so swamped with a particular project that grows in complexity each and every day. Perfectionism is not the only issue, completionism (making up a word here) seems to be the substance that might make it seem that I‚Äôm in suspended animation. I hope you all had a wonderful holiday last week (for those that celebrate it).
üòä
We've reimagined this scene incorporating the spirit of @lightlifefoods campaign about honesty being the best policy in parenting and in food #ad. As fate would have it just last week our middle two children gave us an opportunity to do just that. Our two middle children were laughing up a storm during their quiet times (a time where they‚Äôre *supposed* to nap). We felt like their bond together was more important than a singular nap so we let the laughter fly. This was a mistake. Fast forward a few hours to bed times to when we walked Elle to her room and we found tufts of hair showered across the floor. Insert the opportunity for a seriously honest parenting moment.  What honest conversations have you had with your kids? #ATasteOfHonesty

Morning vibes in the lobby of the new @thehoxtonhotel in downtown LOS Angeles.
Currently sipping: mezcal margaritas at Echo Park‚Äôs @barcalola.
Guess what? It actually rains in LA.‚òîÔ∏è
Chill vibes at downtown LA‚Äôs @firehousehotel, a six room property that also happens to have a killer restaurant and lobby coffee shop.
This is my boyfriend @esspeer and the incredible wall hanging that he just completed for a client in Los Angeles. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of his creative endeavors, and we‚Äôre currently on a flight to deliver and install his work. I also get a trip to LA out of this deal (and the apartment is back in order‚Äîfor a minute, at least ü§™), so I‚Äôm not complaining a bit.
The best thing about @blundstoneusa boots is their versatility: they‚Äôre as comfy and appropriate for a coffee run in the city as they are working, walking, or living anywhere else. I‚Äôm particularly fond of these Rustic Black Classic 550 Chelsea Boots. ü•æ
This is one of my favorite days of the year, #SmallBizSat, because we get to celebrate small businesses‚Äîa practice I try to keep all year around. I love to #shopsmall and support local businesses, and I love that @americanexpress has created a whole day to spotlight them. This year, I‚Äôm having lunch with my team at one of our favorite neighborhood spots, @westbourne. Comment below with your favorite small business in your neighborhood! #AmexAmbassador
#WonderfulPistachiosPartner After my recent trip to Italy, I‚Äôve been craving more orecchiette (which I had pretty much every day while I was there). For this recipe, I made a pistachio pesto using @WonderfulpPistachios No Shell Lightly Salted, along with a bunch of mint, parsley, Parmesan, and a secret ingredient...Catch my stories (before they disappear!) to get the recipe. #wonderfulnut
This is how the table looked hours ago (with @esspeer‚Äôs latest wall hanging peeking out in the corner), long before the caviar-topped tater tots, the garlic kimchi Brussels sprouts, the tahini-laden honeynut squash, and the tiny little partridges were all devoured. Tbh, a few of those menu items failed, üò¨ but I got to spend the day with loved ones in our cozy little apartment, and that‚Äôs what mattered most.

"‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm a handful baby‚Äù, part of the new series ‚ÄúRelationship status:‚Äù, where we (@wheresaddie and @aialahernando) use self portraiture as a means of translating/exploring the private as public female experience. 
The artists use site specific real floral arrangements, alongside contemporary artifacts within the artists‚Äô lived experiences; the personal objects strewn across the works serve both as a portrait of the modern women but also of the artists themselves, to create a feeling of longing in the work- to see what is concealed, to understand who is attached. This form of active looking implicates the viewer into the process and highlights further into the series, the role of desire as a (un)productive force.

Stillness in movement. A rare capture of a moving figure that evokes a sort of noiselessness reality. An attempt to scape the corporeal existence, a search for more than what the camera can catch. Like a humble Degas, a figure leaving the canvas is not caught in time but passing through time. (Outtake of @cocoowino for @kinfolk)

Con @rominasacre tengo de los mejores recuerdos de mi vida... Fuimos roommates por a√±os en NYC cuando ten√≠amos 20 a√±os y fue de las etapas m√°s divertidas, libres y hipsters de nuestras vidas y donde m√°s extravagancias hice (estudiaba artes visuales, escultura, pintura, ten√≠a mi negocio de fotograf√≠a, hac√≠a m√∫sica en pro tools para cortometrajes, ten√≠a un grupo alternativo de rap con Rominaü§î... si es netaüòÇ, hac√≠amos performances en las calles, andaba en patineta, entre muchas otras cosas, y lo √∫ltimo que imaginaba es que terminar√≠a siendo actriz)... De hecho pueden leer un poco m√°s de nuestra extra√±a historia juntas en su p√°gina web rominamedia.com 
P.D. adjunto algunas fotos vergonzosas de nuestra juventud."

Gracias @sofiaberlangav por esta aventura! Ha sido algo realmente hermoso. En la p√°gina de @morenacorazon hay mucha m√°s informaci√≥n al respecto!

Este fue uno de los viajes m√°s especiales que he hecho. 
Aqu√≠ estoy con Basilia, una de las artesanas que ayud√≥ en la creaci√≥n de las piezas que sacaremos pr√≥ximamente para @morenacorazon 
Me emociona demasiado este proyecto. Ojal√° podamos cruzar fronteras para que se conozcan m√°s estos talentos hermosos y sigamos d√°ndole vida a estas comunidades. 
PD. gracias a todos los que tienen inter√©s en conocer la manera c√≥mo trabajamos con los artesanos, les cuento que cuando decid√≠ participar en este proyecto fue lo primero de lo que me empape. Ellos llevan m√°s de 5 a√±os trabajando por medio de comercio justo con la comunidad, los capacitan y proveen un espacio de trabajo donde es dif√≠cil de encontrarlo. Los invito a visitar las redes y canal de youtube de la marca para que conozcan el gran trabajo qu√© hacen desde hace tiempo con ellos."
"Hace poco decid√≠ unirme con @morenacoraz√≥n para idear algo juntas ya que soy demasiado fan del arte huichol mexicano. As√≠ que emprendimos un viaje a una comunidad huichol en Nayarit donde pude convivir con esta gente tan noble y talentosa, ver los espectaculares paisajes que tiene Mexico en sus comunidades a√∫n v√≠rgenes, conocer a√∫n m√°s sobre la cultura huichol y sus tradiciones y crear junto con ellos esta nueva colecci√≥n!

"One of the most beautiful things about landmarks is that even if they are incredibly famous, each one of us has his/her own memory, an intimate interpretation of what's seen by millions. ‚ú®
5 years ago I was starting to work as a product designer (that's what I graduated in), but I wasn't really certain about it. That's because deep within myself I knew what I really wanted to do, but I was scared to acknowledge that.ü§ê
Somehow I started posting pictures here on Instagram, and as I wanted to create new content, I visited Paris with my mother & sisters.
I just had a tiny camera with 2 lenses, but I really loved exploring the city and experimenting with my new gear.ü§ì
Among all the places I saw, there was one that really got me: Notre-Dame.üïç
I visited its incredible interiors, went up to its balcony (even if back then I was pretty much afraid of heights), and on the last day, I decided to wake up really early to take a picture with no tourists.
.
That was the first time I woke up before sunrise for taking a photograph.
That was one of the first moments when I realized what I truly wanted to be in my life: a photographer.üì∑
I was so proud of that picture back then [you can see it as a 2nd picture in this post], while I smile when I look at it now. 
I still had so much to learn.
.
I went back to Paris 2 years later, and I couldn't miss the morning meeting with my past muse; so I again woke up early, and I shot the very first lights of day on a pretty cold and windy morning.
It was as beautiful as 2 years earlier.
.
I somehow thought this would become a ""classic appointment"" in my life, a morning meeting every few years with Notre-Dame, in the silence of the dawn, just with the sound of the wind and of the river Seine.
Now though, a vast portion of that majestic beauty has turned to ashes.
It's inexplicable, unbelievable, but sadly true.
.
I am grateful for having had the chance to see you, and portray your unique beauty at the best that I could.
Dear Notre-Dame, your original grace will be deeply missed.üôèüèª"

__________________________________________
Architectural Photography is not just ""taking pictures of architecture"". Actually, it's all about understanding the essence of the project and translating that on a 2-dimensional plane, a photograph. üì∑
Architects spend years designing, planning, and executing projects of this kind, and we as viewers should stop more often to admire in awe of their work. üòÆ
Here's my suggestion for you: next time you see a beautiful building in your city, try to stop for a second and wonder ""Why is it like this?"" and ""What did the architect want to communicate with this?"".
This will help you open up your mind to a new way of interpretation of what you see.ü§©

__________________________________________
As an #archilover I always find it interesting when new architectures are built close to historical ones. In this picture you can see the K√∂lner Dom, a medieval church built in the 1200, and the three Kranhaus, built in the early 2000s.
‚û°Ô∏è Which one do you prefer?‚ùì

I had just been back from the US üá∫üá≤; I was facing a pretty huge jet-lag and I didn't have time to get over it, as I had a very tight schedule in K√∂ln. üíº
Tired and sleepy, after a very long day, I still wanted to photograph this amazing architectural complex, which was just a 10-min walk from my apartment.
Once arrived to the shooting location I thought that this would have been the perfect opportunity to test my #huaweip20pro Night Mode üåÜ as I just needed to activate the mode and press the shutter button, something doable even if this tired.
I gave it a try and ""oh boy!üòÆ"", I have been really amazed by the results, as it captured and incredible amount of light over a few seconds, giving me a pretty clean & detailed picture, all without needing a tripod! ü§Ø
‚Ü©Ô∏è
Back in university I graduated in design (industrial design to be specific), and that really opened my mind in terms of understanding that behind each object, even the most simple one, there's so, so much work. 
Some might think that design is that frivolous thing that ""makes things beautiful"", but it's quite the opposite. To design, is to create something that works, that makes life easier to someone, just as making a jet-lagged traveler take night shots with its phone.
Beauty lies within the essence of the function itself.

Living out of a suitcaseüíº, without the ""daily comforts"" that we all give for granted (just like making espresso‚òï whenever I want one), was an incredibly valuable life lesson. üôè
It taught me that I don't really need all the material things that I have, that we as humans have an incredible capacity to adapt, and that we are biased by our own culture more than we might think of.
After all, it taught me that the true essence of traveling is to embrace whatever we encounter like a child would, with no judgment whatsoever, bearing nothing more than curiosity and the desire to learn üåü"

I guess there‚Äôs nothing really to say. I‚Äôm sad. The climbing world lost a true light. Rest in peace..."
"Yesterday I had the pleasure of climbing the Misty Wall (12 pitch 5.13a) with @sannimccandless (who got this rad belay pic). It‚Äôs a pretty impressive route next to Yosemite Falls first freed by @sashadigiulian,  @jon_cardwell and @mgclimber1 - which I found to be an impressive effort on their part since there‚Äôs so much wide climbing and groveling. Seems like it must have been a super hard style for folks who don‚Äôt climb in Yosemite much. 
Lovely outing in a lovely place - slowly winding down the Yosemite season..."
Had a ton of fun forerunning and enjoying the new problems at Planet Granite Fountain Valley this morning. Seeing these gyms come together makes me stoked to be a part of the Planet Granite family. If you live in the area, sign up for updates or get your membership at planetgranite.com
"This is a photo of @tommycaldwell looking calm and collected while sending a 5.13c (8a+) corner pitch on the third night of our recent new route on El Cap. I included a pic of me looking incredibly gripped while trying to clip a bolt from our first night on the wall for contrast. 
I‚Äôve always known that Tommy was an incredible big wall climber; I grew up watching films about his feats. And we‚Äôve had enough big adventures over the years that I‚Äôve gotten to see some of his best performances first hand (Fitz Traverse, or the Free Triple...). But spending 4 days with him on El Cap really highlighted the fact that he‚Äôs maybe the best big wall climber in the world. On nights 2 and 3 he spent several hours after dark to work and then send a 13d and 13c pitch. Both pitches were freakin hard with slightly finicky gear but he just worked it all out and executed perfectly. Both nights I got too cold and too scared and opted to wait until morning and climb them in the light. After 7 years of working on the Dawn Wall Tommy is truly an incredible night climber. I‚Äôd say it was a sight to behold, except that I couldn‚Äôt see anything - I just fed out rope while he sent through the night. 
Anyway, it was inspiring to see Tommy‚Äôs level of skill and effort up there. And it‚Äôs the kind of thing that often goes unrecognized behind ‚Äúthey climbed a new route‚Äù. But how he climbed it was remarkable. 
Thanks @austin_siadak for the great photos and keeping us company through the long nights..."
I had the pleasure of supporting @emilyaharrington on an in-a-day attempt on Golden Gate (30+ pitch 13a) yesterday. It was pretty inspiring to see her try her best and fight her way up to the last hard pitch. No send, but a lot of learning and character building, which is kind of all we‚Äôre after in wall climbing...
@tommycaldwell just posted about our recent journey up El Cap so I figured I‚Äôd join in. We climbed a new free line that follows @leo_houlding‚Äôs old route Passage to Freedom and continues 20 more pitches to the top. Incredible 5.13+ corners up high. @austin_siadak spent 4 days on the wall with us documenting and helping with all the bigwall toil. An incredible experience which reminded me that Tommy really is the best big wall climber in the world and that I still have a lot to learn. Nothing like El Cap to humble you...
"A rare live update from the side of El Cap. @austin_siadak toiling away on fixed lines while @tommycaldwell and I try to get psyched to put climbing shoes back on... still a long way to the top...
@austin_siadak happens to be a very talented, and very single, photographer/videographer. In case anyone needs some big wall filming. Or a major wall hunk in their life..."
I‚Äôve been playing around up on El Cap with @tommycaldwell, @kjorgeson and @austin_siadak recently. This is Tommy styling one of many 5.13 corners, though this one was originally freed by @leo_houlding 20 years ago. Good times back on the wall...
@carlodenali looking pretty relaxed on 5.13. Turns out that when you can boulder V15 climbing sport routes is really darn easy.

"LE PREGUNTE A MI MADRE COMO  SE PIERDE LA VIDA ?

La vida se pierde de muchas formas hijo.
Se pierde cuando quieres vivir la vida de otros y no la tuya.
Se pierde criticando los errores de otros, y no mejorando los tuyos. 
Se pierde cuando te lamentas a cada momento por haber fracasado y no buscar soluciones para poder triunfar.
Se pierde , cuando te la pasas envidiando a los dem√°s , y no super√°ndote a ti mismo .
Se pierde cuando te enfocas en cosas negativas  y dejas de disfrutas las cosas buenas .
LA VIDA NO SE PIERDE CUANDO DEJAS DE RESPIRAR ,
SINO CUANDO DEJAS DE SER FELIZ ..."

Lazy days on the Oregon Coast. I spent most of my life inland, preferably around big rocky things but every few months I crave seeing the ocean for a few days. Here‚Äôs a slice from one of our latest trips in the PNW..
Cold days out West. Working with @CanonUSA to put the EOS 1DX Mark II through the paces while shooting a Fjallr√§ven story a few months back. These kind of projects are my favorite because of how demanding they are; freezing temps and on the move from sunrise to sunset with an awesome crew. #CoCreateWithCanon
Happy to be helping @polarpro launch their new Summit Series Filters.. Took them on an early fall field trip in the mountains around home to see what the fuss was all about. Even made a film for them about what it means to be an adventure photographer. Link in profile If you‚Äôre curious, I‚Äôve never spent so much time writing and re-writing a film ‚úåüèª
We came to South Greenland in part to sail among Icebergs. This is one of the most remarkable ones we saw on our trip. For a moment we thought about driving the boat through the arch to get a closer look at it but the captain quickly deterred us from it from fears of it collapsing on us.. What a beast
The Greenland ice sheet. This is a panorama of 12 horizontal photos, just to give you a sense of the scale of this place. Just a few years ago, the ice fell into the water but in you can see that it is retracting over the rock now and will continue to do until its no longer visible from the sea. Powerful seeing our changing climate first hand..
Finally got around editing one of my favourite photos from the Greenland trip. This is Sebastien, our rad skipper from France on the @auroraarktika, taking the crew back to the boat..

december always feels like an appropriate time to reflect. it's of course the end of the year, but also my birthday month, so it's the end of "another" year for me, too. more than ever, i feel incredibly lucky to live in this crazy city, work on projects that are creatively challenging and fulfilling, and most importantly, be healthy enough to work out and run around. [#ad] i'm excited to be partnering with @olivela on their $1 million dollar pledge this holiday season. if you are also feeling lucky and grateful for what you have in your life, i hope you'll take a minute out of your day to sign up your email on http://olivela.com. for every email sign-up, olivela will donate $5 (they‚Äôve upped it to $10 on this giving tuesday! and you can choose which of the four charities they're supporting to put your money toward). it's super low effort on your part and can make the biggest difference. thank you so much.

We are thrilled to see so many people unifying over the #climatestrike and are pumped to see all of the individual actions lining up to big changes. Bringing your own water bottle, choosing to train or bus instead of fly and going plant based to name a few. These are massive wins in our community. However, we‚Äôd also like to spread awareness that 71% of human caused climate change is the direct result of only 100 corporations. We urge you to be mindful of where your üíµ are going. We can vote everyday for companies who are working for positive change, and choose not to empower businesses that are harming our planet. We can all choose to consume less. If you are in Vancouver, we‚Äôll be at the #climatestrike at 1pm at City Hall and we‚Äôd love to see you. üì∑ @hadahaa

3. I studied pre-med in college at USC for two years, until I fell in love with photography.

Calm mornings along one of Europe‚Äôs most idyllic villages. This place is pretty much everything you can think of when it comes to a fairytale like setting ‚ú®
Memories from a cold and rainy day this autumn in Switzerland üçÇ After a week of endless sunshine and lots of hours on the road, we embraced a day where we could slow down just a little bit and take things easy. The more I travel, the more I realize how important it is to take time for yourself and enjoy the little moments in order to prevent creative burnout ‚ú® Photo by: @kylekotajarvi
Fall is one of my favorite seasons to travel because of the colorful scenery, fewer crowds and cooler weather üçÇ I‚Äôm sharing all the details about my recent 2 week fall road trip through Europe including what to see and other helpful tips in my latest blog post.

Those little moments that make your heart skip a beat ‚ú® This particular sunset is one I surely won‚Äôt forget anytime soon. We had dreamed of these conditions for awhile at Tre Cime, only to be completely fogged out on our first attempt here. We returned yet again the next day and could not believe our eyes when we saw this inversion layer start to appear. Those few hours of pure bliss we spent watching the clouds dance around us could only be described as magical üåô
Wouldn‚Äôt mind calling this place home. The view isn‚Äôt half bad either ‚ú®
Before our road trip through the Alps came to an end, @kylekotajarvi and I decided to make the extra trip out to the @visitausseerland region. Ever since I came here two years ago, I fell in love with this area of Austria, always yearning to return to see the brilliant fall colors. Even though I‚Äôm sad our trip is coming to an end, this particular morning will leave me with so many great memories. Thanks @mondigrundlsee for the hospitality while we were here ‚ú®
I finally got the chance to see the beautiful Engadin region in the Fall and it‚Äôs safe to say that it did not disappoint. The whole time we were here we were in awe of the sea of larches that completely surrounded us in their brilliant shades of yellow and orange. Swipe left for a few more scenes from this special day we had exploring this gem of a place üçÇ
Hi, it‚Äôs me üëã I‚Äôm on a mountain üèî
This past week on the road has been nothing short of a dream. I‚Äôve loved spending time catching up with old friends and meeting new ones, while making countless memories. Here‚Äôs a moment from one of my favorite hikes in Austria that we did recently.

Esses dias estava reclamando muito da minha rotina intensa de trabalho por ficar muito tempo longe da minha fam√≠lia, amigos e principalmente da minha Esposa gr√°vida. 
Quase desisti de vir pra √Åfrica esse ano... Foi quando mexendo no meu cel achei essa foto do ano passado. Reparem com aten√ß√£o:

Estava fazendo uma ora√ß√£o quando o @isthisreal registrou o momento em que um raio de luz corta o c√©u e vai de encontro com o Baob√°, √Årvore sagrada que simboliza vida e carrega consigo a for√ßa da resist√™ncia africana. 
E o que significa isso? Para alguns apenas coincid√™ncia do acaso. 
Pra mim ficou claro a mensagem divina para continuarmos firmes na miss√£o e na luta por dignidade humana. Cada sorriso e cada vida transformada faz valer a pena nosso esfor√ßo.

DEUS, ponho-me a disposi√ß√£o para usar das b√™n√ß√£os e instrumentos que me deu para servir, porque esse √© o verdadeiro sucesso.

Alert: read until the end.

These days I was complaining a lot about my intense work routine for being too far away from my family, friends and especially my pregnant Wife.

I almost gave up on coming to Africa this year ... That's when fiddling with my cel phone  I found this picture from last year. 
Notice carefully:

He was saying a prayer when @isthisreal restricted the moment when a ray of light cuts through the sky and meets the Baobab, a sacred tree that symbolizes life and carries with it the strength of African resistance.

And what does this mean? For some just coincidence of chance.
For me it was clear the divine message to remain firm in the mission and the struggle for human dignity. Every smile and every transformed life is worth our effort.

God, I am willing to use the blessings and instruments that Have been given me to serve, because that is the true success.

"Happy Birthday my love üéâ‚ô•Ô∏è I am so incredibly proud of you and the person you have become üôèüèº Almost 9 years ago we met and you instantly took my heart ü•∞  Amongst the thousands of people in the crowd at that music festival, I knew you had something special. You drew me in with your carefree, fun & energetic nature and had me fall at you feet when I really got to know you over the years to come...
Your ability to make everyone around you comfortable, your sense of adventure, your creativity, your love for your family and friends, the way you give 100% effort to everything you do, your sense of humour and the way you make people light up with laughter, your loyalty, your eagerness to try new things, the way you don‚Äôt care what other people think, and of course, your love and compassion for the world you live in (especially our environment and it‚Äôs animals).
It‚Äôs the last few years, when we‚Äôve come across our biggest life challenges that I have truly understood how incredible you are and how lucky I am to have you in my life üôèüèº
There‚Äôs not many couples that can say that they live together, socialise together, workout together, cook together & run a full time business together from home (spending almost every hour of the day with each other)...for almost 5years now!...and...every morning, you still look me in the eyes and say ‚Äògood morning my love!‚Äô and are oozing excited energy to spend yet another 24hrs trying to live our best lives and conquer our dreams, together..
You inspire me with your passion, determination, work ethic, and ability to fight back after ANY setback. Everyday I am better because of you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
So,
Here‚Äôs to you, my love.
And to all the magnificent things you are yet to do, experience & create! ‚ú®
I love you ‚ô•Ô∏è"

"Photo by @amivitale. Reteti Elephant Sanctuary keepers take Shaba and Pokot out for one final nature walk in Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy in northern Kenya prior to their re-introduction into the wild. Rescued as young calves, Shaba had been cared for by the dedicated team at Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e) for three years and Pokot for two before they were ready to return to the wild. The team had grown very close to each of the animals. They spend more time with these elephants than with their own families and deep bonds had formed. This final walk was a way for everyone to say goodbye before the elephants were transferred to nearby Sera Conservancy for their release (along with Mpala who is not in this photo). Shaba, Mpala and Pokot were reintroduced to the wild on Nov. 16. All are doing well. They have successfully reintegrated into one of the nearby wild herds, which is exactly what all had hoped would happen. Their easy integration is a testament to the knowledge and hard work of all the keepers at @r.e.s.c.u.e. @r.e.s.c.u.e is the first ever community owned elephant sanctuary in all of Africa. What‚Äôs happening at Reteti is nothing less than the beginnings of a transformation not only in the way humans relate to wild animals but also how we relate to one another. This oasis where orphans grow up, learning to be wild so that one day they can rejoin their herds, is a story as much about the elephants as it is about all of humanity.

"Photos by @amivitale. The wondrous Pokot, who has been lovingly cared for by the team at Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e) for 2 years, has returned to the wild. Pokot arrived at @r.e.s.c.u.e when he was just 6-months-old, a victim of the drought. It took days of intensive care to nurse him back to health. When signs of playfulness began to emerge, they knew they had turned a corner. He quickly became a staff favorite. He's known at the sanctuary as ‚ÄúSangalia‚Äù which means ""lone bull."" He is kind, gentle and calm and can entertain himself endlessly with games of soccer and diving in the mud-bath, absorbed in his own little world.

Pokot was reintroduced into the wild alongside Shaba and Mpala on Nov. 16. The three are doing wonderfully and have even integrated into one of the wild herds in the area. @r.e.s.c.u.e is the first ever community owned and operated elephant sanctuary in all of Africa. Its goal is to care for and rehabilitate orphaned elephant calves back into the wild. These three and their success in quick re-integration is a testament to the team's knowledge, ability and dedication.

"Photos by @amivitale. Mpala, the most enchanting orphaned elephant who was lovingly cared for at Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e) for the past two and a half years has finally returned to the wild. Three-year-old Mpala was the rambunctious one. She arrived at @r.e.s.c.u.e when she was 7-months-old, a victim of the drought. She integrated into the herd quickly. Her place was in the middle of it all. If there was a ruckus to be had, she was throwing back her trunk and rumbling in the muck, enjoying a refreshing mud bath. She has been carefully re-introduced into the wild alongside proxy matriarch Shaba and lone-bull Pokot under the guidance of @kenyawildlifeservice. The three are doing wonderfully in the wild and have joined one of the wild herds in the area, which is exactly what we had hoped for.

"Photos by @amivitale. Beloved orphan elephant Shaba who has been lovingly cared for at Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e) for the past three years has returned to the wild. To say she will be missed is an understatement. Shaba arrived at @r.e.s.c.u.e traumatized when she was just over a year old. Her mother had been killed by poachers. She was distrustful, and wanted nothing to do with the team. The dedicated keepers at @r.e.s.c.u.e didn't give up. They spent day and night, talking, singing, offering her seed pods and fresh grass‚Äîanything they could think of to win her over so that she would accept a bottle. Then, one day, after one of the keepers stood with her for an hour in a stack of tires, she finally took a bottle, and a strong bond was formed.

Shaba has been the proxy matriarch at the sanctuary since @r.e.s.c.u.e's founding in 2016. She would take care of the newly arrived orphans, making sure they were protected and felt nurtured when they were vulnerable and weak. She taught all of the keepers how to be with these beautiful creatures who needed help. It was a delight to watch her teaching the younger ones how to navigate steep paths, to strip bark from trees and find the freshest browse. It was unforgettable seeing her comfort the little ones with a reassuring gesture of her trunk.

Our hearts are full knowing that she is back in the wild where she belongs. We will never forget her. To everyone‚Äôs delight, Shaba, Pokot and Mpala have successfully integrated into one of the wild herds near the sanctuary. This is the best outcome we could have hoped for.

"Photo by @amivitale. Cattle owned by the Fulani Mbororo are milked before they head out to graze in the early morning hours near a remote village in Chad. The Mbororo people are nomadic cattle-herders and traders and move every few days with their animals in search of fresh grazing land and water.

I'm here on behalf of @rippleeffectimages documenting the work of Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim (@hindououmar), who is working to harness the centuries of wisdom and weather-predicting techniques among the indigenous Mbororo to adapt to the impact of climate change. @hindououmar is a leader in both AFPAT (Association of Peul Women and Autochthonous Peoples of Chad) and within the @UN advocate for the powerful role indigenous people have in addressing climate change. Watch for her powerful talks as she takes the stage this week at #COP25. @hindououmar's work most recently earned her the prestigious 2019 Pritzker Environmental Genius Award administered by  @uclaioes that I was proud to nominate her for.

I live in the Hudson Valley of New York with my husband and daughter. When we moved here about 10 years ago, I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would feel rural enough and if we would connect to the landscape. These images reflect the deep and personal relationship we have built with this beautiful place ‚Äì our home. There‚Äôs our favorite swimming hole, fishing streams and the rail trail we run and walk along almost every day. We are moving to Upstate NY this summer and I will miss these places and moments but look forward to discovering a connection in our new home.  @apple #ApplePartner #hudsonvalley #home #wallkillvalleyrailtrail @mattmoyerphoto @thephotosociety

"Se c‚Äô√® una cosa che ho imparato sulla vita in 24 anni √® che la nostra natura umana ci spinge a pensare sempre o al passato o al futuro. Alcuni di noi vivono costantemente nei ricordi ed altri non fanno altro che pensare al domani; ed √® proprio cos√¨ che ci perdiamo ‚Äúla vita‚Äù, che non ci rendiamo conto che il presente, forse, √® uno dei regali pi√π belli; fatto di attimi, vissuto senza pensieri, vivendo semplicemente la vita cos√¨ come viene.
Questa √® una delle foto pi√π belle che io abbia di me stessa negli ultimi anni perch√® mi ritrae nell‚Äôattimo esatto in cui stavo pensando ‚Äúquanto cazzo √® bella la vita oggi‚Äù; il sole sulla pelle, in una parte del mondo magnifica, guardando un tramonto spettacolare circondata di mille sfumature. Faceva proprio bene all‚Äôanima. √à cos√¨ che si dovrebbe guardare il mondo, assaporando qualsiasi colore, viaggiando ogni secondo possibile e nutrendo lo spirito di attimi bellissimi. Il presente era futuro ed √® passato, non sprechiamolo mai!

Remember we only have one body and it is our duty to treat it well and maximize it‚Äôs capabilities. Recently someone asked where do I get the energy to workout and honestly I am just like anyone else. Sometimes it feels like I might be more on the low days than on the energetic side. The thing is I don‚Äôt see workouts as a burden, it is part of my lifestyle already. On days when I‚Äôm on the low is the HABIT I‚Äôve created and programed already into my brain through CONSISTENCY that keeps me going. Good habits or bad ones aren‚Äôt created overnight they form through time and if we aren‚Äôt mindful enough we can be reinforcing the wrong ones. . .

A long #walkabout today around the bustling morning markets in #Jakarta. Set to be the largest city on Earth by 2030. I found these guys battling vampires the old fashioned way. I appreciated that. Remember, when you can‚Äôt find good light, find the absence of it. #sonya7iii @sonyalpha #50mm

I enjoyed spending time with this man today, somewhere outside Bandung, West Java. He would only speak to me through his marionette. I asked if I could take his picture and the marionette said ‚Äútidak‚Äù which means no. Then we shared a smoke. I don‚Äôt even smoke. But the marionette lightened up after that. Thanks wizard for the memory.
Delving ever deeper into Indonesia‚Äôs mainland today. Letting the moments find me. It‚Äôs been an interesting and unexpected week, filled to the brim with ups and downs. Looking forward to the adventure to come.

Why am I so happy? We just finished one of the wildest, most successful @sealegacy expeditions to date, logging countless hours in the water with blue whales and documenting the most biodiverse coral reefs on the planet alongside my friends @paulnicklen @mitty @samkretch @fizzyfarfaraway @ryantidman @kyle.roepke throughout Timor Leste. A huge thank you to @zodiacwatches for funding this important expedition, allowing us to do the work needed to help protect this fragile environment. Follow @zodiacwatches for exclusive content from the trip and stay tuned for a big post coming on Giving Tuesday! Lots of love y‚Äôall. üíôüêã
Oceanic whitetips, gathered and ready. It‚Äôs so rare to get this many oceanics within any resemblance of an ‚Äúorganized‚Äù frame. I love it when it happens though. Such a special evening out in the deep. Follow along with us @sealegacy for a deeper look into the many Bahamas ecosystems and many challenges facing this fragile island nation.
A great white shark about to breach the cold waters off of Guadelupe Island, Mexico. Resembling a certain movie poster, this image was the result of practice, patience & a hell of a lot of luck. Situated in the Pacific, 240km off Mexico‚Äôs Baja California peninsula, Guadalupe is one of the world‚Äôs premier locations for observing great white sharks. Approx 200 people reside on the island, most of them abalone and lobster fisherman. @sonyalpha #a9 #bealpha @sealegacy #sharks #uwphotography
Today is the official launch of the new @zodiacwatches Super Sea Wolf 68 Saturation X Andy Mann Edition. (Link in Bio) Whoa! What a ride it has been the last 14 months designing this piece inspired by my muse, the Oceanic Whitetip Shark. When the team at Zodiac asked me to design a dive watch inspired by my ocean adventures, I took it seriously. I flew to Biel, Switzerland to study with third-generation watchmakers, work on the design and break a few Swiss watchmaking traditions along the way (thanks guys!) The Oceanic Whitetip was recently listed under the Endangered Species Act and I‚Äôm proud to continue documenting the science being done to help it recover. A huge thank you to Zodiac for not only helping me through this process but fully funding our next @sealegacy expedition to Timor Leste next month! It's time to let her fly! #DivewithPurpose #ZodiacWatches

"The official theme of today‚Äôs #worldaidsday is ‚ÄúCommunities Make The Difference‚Äù... The theme recognises the vital role that communities are playing both to prevent new HIV infections, and deliver life-saving health services to people already living with HIV. 
This resonates deeply at mothers2mothers a community and organization im proud to be a part of since 2015.
Their peer-based model is rooted in the communities they serve. Every day, they witness the power of African women employed and trained as frontline health workers who deliver transformative health outcomes in their OWN communities as what we call ‚ÄòMentor Mothers‚Äô. Since starting in 2001, m2m has employed more than 10,000 local women who, together, have reached more than 11 million women and children!  Only together we can create a generation free of HIV ‚ô•Ô∏è"

Muito feliz em receber pela segunda vez o pr√™mio de mulher do ano pela @gqbrasil . Faz t√£o pouco tempo que recebi esse pr√™mio na primeira vez que ainda me lembro de cada detalhe. E o que mudou daqui pra l√°? TUDO. Vejo uma mulher mais madura, consciente e, principalmente, realizada. Esse foi o ano onde terminei de completar minha lista de sonhos profissionais. Sim, eu escrevi uma lista pra n√£o esquecer quais eram meus objetivos e quando eu estaria satisfeita profissionalmente. Eu cheguei l√°. Foi t√£o r√°pido. Completei tudo e ainda teve muito mais de b√¥nus. Eu sou t√£o nova que faz parecer que foi tudo f√°cil f√°cil, mas s√≥ parece mesmo. Minha dedica√ß√£o e sangue nos olhos que n√£o deixaria ser diferente. Obrigada por encerrar este ciclo da minha vida me consagrando dessa forma @gqbrasil ... meu sonho agora √© que mais gente se sinta como eu me sinto agora profissionalmente, mais mulheres, mais funkeiros, mais batalhadores. Obrigada f√£s, equipe e fam√≠lia.

"Masa indah ‚Äúsantai bersama keluarga‚Äù 6 tahun yang lalu. Sejak menikah, Ani dan saya menganut dan menjalankan falsafah hidup ‚Äúlove, care and share‚Äù. Manis, tapi sering tak mudah. Namun selalu ada jalan untuk mewujudkannya.
*SBY* ‚ûñ ‚ÄúA relaxing day with the family‚Äù, it‚Äôs such a beautiful memory of 6 years ago. Since we got married, Ani and I believed to embrace and live up the philosophy of ‚Äúlove, care and share‚Äù. It‚Äôs sweet, but it‚Äôs not easy. But there‚Äôs always a way to make it happens. *SBY*"
"1973, empat puluh enam tahun yang lalu, adalah tahun yang penuh kenangan. Saya dan Ani dipertemukan Tuhan di kampus Akademi Militer Magelang. Waktu itu saya taruna senior (tingkat 4) dan Ani mahasiswi kedokteran UKI Jakarta. Di Lembah Tidar inilah kasih sayang kami berdua mulai bersemi, menembus dimensi ruang dan waktu, mengarungi perjalanan yang panjang dan berliku, hingga takdir memisahkan kami 6 bulan yang lalu. Rest in peace, Memo. Bawalah kenangan manis ini dalam kehidupanmu yang baru. *SBY* ‚ûñ

Fourty-six years ago, in 1973, it was a year that full of memories. By God‚Äôs blessing, Ani and I met each other at the Military Academy in Magelang. At that time, I was a senior cadet (level 4) and Ani was a student of medical school in UKI Jakarta. In this Lembah Tidar our love story began, went through beyond the dimension of space and time, crossing through the long and winding journey, until fate brought us apart six months ago. Rest in peace, Memo. Please take this sweet memory to your eternal life. *SBY*"

Kami juga telah menerima 5 kiriman buku (Al Quran; 2 Kumpulan Tulisan Aa Gym ‚ÄúIkhtiar Meraih Ridha Allah‚Äù; dan 2 Buku Doa yang dikirim Teh Ninih). Insya Allah kandungan Al Quranul Karim dan buku-buku yang dikirim tersebut akan menjadi sarana dan jalan untuk kesembuhan saya. Terima kasih. Salam."
"Terima kasih kepada sahabat saya, Mantan Ibu Negara Amerika Serikat, Laura Bush dan Presiden George W. Bush yang telah mengirimkan surat guna memberikan doa bagi kesembuhan saya. Surat ini tentunya akan menjadi tambahan semangat bagi saya, Pak SBY dan keluarga dalam menjalani pengobatan saya. Sekali lagi terima kasih.

"Today was BACK-day! Little breathing a little sweating and lots of laughs. 
Mentally reloading after 5 stressful weeks. The OPEN is still as hard on me as it was 10 years ago. Physically but even more so mentally. Testing always brings out butterflies, but that‚Äôs why we do this right? The excitement of becoming the best YOU and putting your ability to the test!  #lovewhatyou #enjoythejourney #intheopen #refreshandreload #DCCnext #bisandtris"

‚ÄúDoing nothing is better than being busy doing nothing‚Äù -Lao Tzu ‚ú® #mindset #mindfulness #taoist #taoism #zen
Listen üåä Sitting in one of the Vortex spots in Sedona. I can get lost in the calmness of this stream üòå They say that Sedona alone is a vortex of universal energy and I must agree. I honestly didn‚Äôt think I would be so impress by Sedona after seeing the magical Alps in Switzerland but it is a mystical land of its own. This is such an amazing place to come speak and listen to your inner self. Have you taken the time to go within and visit yourself? üôè #sedonavortex #sedona #simplepleasures #mindbodysoul #mindfulness
Sedona ‚òÄÔ∏è Another remarkable place to see and feel. üôè I really hope our next generations will take better care of our planet. People have been so consumed with making life convenient that we forget to appreciate our Mother Earth. I‚Äôm definitely guilty of falling into the comfort lifestyle, consumerism, wasteful consumption, and taking our resource for granted. It‚Äôs so easy to be blinded and caught up into modern comfort that we then become ungrateful. Moving forward, I really hope to be a better example on how I live. I hope life will inspire you too.... if you question what is your purpose in life, here it is... LIVE more, consume LESS. #earth #nature #sedona #sedonavortex
Been through some incredible moments these past few months! Its‚Äôs amazing how time keeps on moving and all we have left are blurred memories, photos, and notes to bring us back. What are you keeping from the past? Are they serving you? Maybe it‚Äôs time to clear out the past that don‚Äôt serve you anymore. Every moment that you are breathing, you are given the opportunity to start creating the life you deserve. Learn from, clear, and delete those old experiences... a new path is ahead. #mindfulliving #mindset
‚ÄúLife is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don‚Äôt resist them; that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.‚Äù Lao Tzu #taoist #tao #mindfulness #earthfocus
The beginning of this year started out a bit funky for me. I tried to stay positive and kept telling myself... change your thoughts. Inside I felt gloomy, tired, and uninspired. There are so many motivational, mindsets, and things we can do to uplift our spirits but if we don‚Äôt embrace how we honestly feel then that feeling will never go away. It‚Äôs okay to not be positive, happy, and 100% all the time. Sometimes our spirit is releasing suppressed emotions or processing internally. Don‚Äôt resist and feel ashamed. Growth isn‚Äôt graceful as when a flower blooms, it‚Äôs when the seed sprouts finding sunlight through the dirt... Then, if it survives through the rain and wind, it becomes the flower. üåª
I had to spend a week alone in solitude after coming back from a month trip! The trip was an amazing experience I will never forget but I am eager to get back into my routine! New video about my week spent alone and why I didn‚Äôt just jump into my normal routine (link in bio)! @olay #ad #retinol24
Once upon a time... a pirate & mermaid became best friends üíïüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Thought I would miss Halloween because of my cold but I got to pretend I was a mermaid with my pirate for the day! ‚ú®
Cheers to a new Birthday, new year to Love and celebrate Life ü•Ç üéÇ‚ù§Ô∏è So grateful for this opportunity on earth to keep on going and experiencing this magnificent force we call life üôè‚ú®
"Will miss you Switzerland üá®üá≠! What an incredible place this has been. I tried packing light for this trip but with the cold weather and electronics I need to take with me for work, it still weighs in. @troylindner and I did not factor in the staircases in Europe and so when we stayed at @hotelsilberhornwengen we finally got a chance to really relaxed on the trip üò¥ .

Jungfrau is a super beautiful region to visit. One major thing to note is everyone  must leave their car in a parking lot before entering up the region by @jungfraujochtopofeurope railway üöÉ . You also must bring all the belongings you want into the train to get to up into town - where most of the beautiful hotels are. Most hotels are up wavy pathways and staircases. Great for backpackers! Luckily for us hotel Silberhorn was right across the train station with a magnificent view. It was a great break from all the carrying we had to do. The whole stay was quiet and and very beautiful (swipe to see!). Thank you for the incredible experience of a lifetime! üôèüá®üá≠‚ù§Ô∏è #jungfraujoch #hotelsilberhorn #troyanntravels"
One of my favorite experiences in Switzerland is the Jungfrau train ride up lol üôå‚ú® The scenery is phenomenal!!! What a scenic ride up to the top of Europe ‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üá≠An experience worth doing in this lifetime! Thank you to all my European and traveler friends for giving me your recommendations, suggestions, and feedback to places!

He was kind, he was humble, he was gentle and he was brilliant . A maestro, as I always called him. Subbu will always remain one of the most loved and respected makeup artists in the country. He made me look beautiful every time he touched my face with his exceptional skills. And will be remembered for all the beautiful work he has left behind and all the lives he has touched.

London-based @flow.architecture with Maria Grazia Savito have extensively redeveloped a Victorian terraced house in London. The project consists of the complete demolition and reconstruction of the existing dwelling ‚Äî a large four-storey end-of-terrace house, originally built in 1851 ‚Äî together with the addition of a basement and a double-height rear-extension. Natural light plays a key role in the project: two large frameless skylights are positioned at the top of the courtyard and the open staircase to enhance the permeability of the building. As a result, abundant daylight fills the heart of the dwelling, carving out the volumes from the original mass and creating a series of fascinating effects. / üì∏ @studio_naaro
"Located in the city of Merida, Yucatan, @filuxlab represents a versatile space that works as a gallery, as a workshop and as a place of coexistence, camaraderie and research for artistic purposes.
The ground floor has five rooms, which were part of the original structure of the house before the intervention. The pasta floor carpets of the first corridor are the originals. An edge of Antique White color mosaics joins the originals to the new flooring, which unites old and new flooring across the entirety of the space. The design of the laboratory enables it to adapt according to its intended use. All the elements that make up its architecture including floors, walls, ceilings, and doors can be used for artistic interventions. White and neutral colors came from this same need. / üì∏ @tamarauribeph"

One of my favorite photos from #Svaneti, Georgia!  Lit-up by burning birch torches in the shadows of 13th century towers, villagers in Mulakhi pour alcohol on the graves of relatives in a ceremony/festival called Lamproba (Lamps Festival). The festival pre-dates the arrival of Christianity and is one of the oldest preserved traditions in the region of its kind.  Ive heard two stories of its meaning:  One says the lamps were to warm the souls of the dead, another story said it was a pagan ritual asking the deities for healthy crops and good weather.  #Sakartvelo for @natgeo
The villages of Ushguli in #Svaneti (Georgia) are even more dramatic when the snows fall!  Completely cut off from the outside world on days like this, these UNESCO world heritage sites look as they must have when these defensive towers were built in the 13th Century.  An unpublished photo from an assignment for @natgeo.
Missing the mountains and mysteries of #Svaneti.  So many beautiful rituals to have witnessed.  Lighting candles in the Lagurka church in Kala, #Sakartvelo.  Unpublished image from a story for @natgeo magazine.
At the Quiricoba Festival in Kala, #Svanetia (in the country of Georgia), young men compete to lift a 300+ lb stone, with the goal of throwing it over their head to land behind them.  Most cannot get the stone off the ground.  Shot on assignment for @NatGeo. #StrongMan Contest #Sakartvelo #DinosaurEgg?
An older image of mine that feels more timely every year.  I wrote a short piece about this assignment for @harpersmagazine called ‚Äúa temporary apocalypse‚Äù talking about the feeling of dropping into emergency zones like big wildfires.  But now all these temporary apocalypses seem to be merging into one big one that never end... #wearetheasteroid (From the Yorba Linda-Corona fire of 2008)
#Sponsored by @GeorgiaTravel // A long time ago, with my first camera, I was lucky enough to stumble into the country of Georgia and it changed my life.  It was waaaay off the beaten path, and #Svanetia, an isolated region surrounded by 17,000 ft peaks, where villages are still made up of clusters of 13th Century defensive towers, was like a dream made real.  It is still a place that feels completely out of time with hikes among the clouds for the adventurous traveller.  To see more of this stunning country follow #GeorgiaTravelMoments

Story by @laurel_braitman and myself was published in @californiasunday mag a couple years back.

"My obsession with photographing human/wildlife relationships can be traced back to this image I made in San Francisco back in 1999. I used to stay up all night prowling around the Presidio making night photos and hoping a raccoon or skunk would cross my path... usually afraid of me, this little dude straight up tried to attack me on the street, snarling and charging me trying to get the bag of chips in my hand. It‚Äôs a two second exposure on medium format film. Kind of a miracle he isn‚Äôt a blur ball. Raccoons have always been an obsession of mine and I‚Äôve spend the past 20 years talking about this grand raccoon photo project I‚Äôve been wanting to explore. And so finally the time has come. Armed with a National Geographic Storytelling grant to collaborate with the amazing writer @laurel_braitman on a story about Raccoon intelligence, and with additional support to photograph an Urban Carnivore feature for @natgeo Magazine, I‚Äôm spending much of the next year digging around your backyards for amazing scenes of raccoon, coyote, and bear debauchery. I‚Äôm gonna need help, so thank you already for the flood of tips about where to find coyotes in Chicago. I‚Äôll keep y‚Äôall informed when I‚Äôm heading to your neighborhood! Meanwhile I live in Portland, so tips here always welcome!

"To add a bit more context to my last post, this is the insanely tight sandstone cave tunnel where I followed wildlife biologist Wesley Larson @grizkid to a 350 pound black bear waking from hibernation at the other end. I‚Äôm not sure how this tunnel was formed, perhaps long ago carved by water and wind, but meeting a bear in there without enough room for us to even turn around seemed pretty hairy at the time. The purpose of this trip was to replace the bears radio tracking collar which was being used to gather data and help mitigate dangerous human / bear encounters in Bryce Canyon National Park. The photos in this carousel show a bit more of the entrance and a shot of Wes looking back maybe wondering if this was a good idea:) I‚Äôm grateful for the chance to follow these guys in action... the complete story can be found in the link in my bio, or in the December 2019 issue of National Geographic Magazine! Spoiler: the bear and all the humans involved are all alive and well:) Also thanks to everyone that sent me urban coyote finding tips in Chicago!

"In love for this project!! Suspended Boxes by @masoudabedimoghadam 
The main idea behind designing this project was to define a new definition for the relationship between the architecture and nature. This project tries to break the conventional description of the border by merging itself in the context.
The architecture has been utterly melted in the forest, and the border between them has been faded. So, the building doesn't impose itself on the context, and tries to establish an intimate friendship with it by allowing the context to penetrate into its heart."

I found my passion for photography 3 years ago during a trip in Canada. Now I can‚Äôt spend a day without taking any photos.‚Ä®I wanted to share with you the best sunrise I‚Äôve seen this year in the French Pyrenees (first photo). The hardest hike I‚Äôve ever done is probably that one because of the weather. The first day up was really foggy. We couldn‚Äôt see anything during the last hour of the hike. A bunch of horses were running in the fog a few meters in front of us. We slept close to this lovely lake and met 2 campers on our way. We woke up at 5.30 am with a clear sky. We hiked to the summit (30/40 min from the lake) and had the best surprise of the year. So worth it : 360view over the Pyrenees, a perfect light and birdsongs. Can‚Äôt complain don‚Äôt you think ? I hope you guys enjoy my takeover today. Free feel to reach out if you'd like to chat about anything :) Be Visually Inspired By! @maximetch

THOT TWAT TIRADE$
Finallllllyyy the end of a long competition seasonü•µ. My first time competing on the World Cup circuit and Olympic qualifying events was exhilarating. It opened my eyes to the hectic schedule that athletes go through year after year. Up until 2019, I was competing in a handful of global competitions a year and focused on school and outdoor climbing goals for the most part. This year, with the Olympics around the corner, I was competing in a different country almost every other week. Preparing for speed, bouldering and lead was a perplexing obstacle all athletes had to deal with after the announcement of the new combined format. It was a big battle of figuring out the right balance of training/ rest for each discipline that still baffles me. There were many moments of joy and laughter on the road and inevitably exhaustion and doubt tagged along as well. The deeper into the season I went, the more ‚Äúworn out‚Äù I felt from the constant tension and pressure of competition climbing. My performance also worsened because of this clouded mindset I developed. Qualifications for the Olympics has been a big goal of mine but this time it didn‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of @kyra_condie , @brookeclimbs and @nathaniel.coleman for climbing superbly and getting tix to Tokyo 2020. It was an honor to be able to represent the USA with an incredible crew of coaches, PTs and athletes.

Today, we give thanks for our blessings, give back to those around us, and enjoy some time ‚Äî and turkey, and maybe a little football ‚Äî with the ones we love. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving.
"Last night, I had the chance to sit down with Stacey Abrams to talk about how Democrats can win up and down the ballot in 2020. There‚Äôs a lot of great work already happening: Stacey‚Äôs Fair Fight effort to end voter suppression, Eric Holder‚Äôs National Democratic Redistricting Committee to draw fair maps, and a lot of big-hearted, forward-looking candidates and campaigns to get people registered and out to the polls.‚Å£
‚Å£
The truth is we win when people vote. The more energized we are, the better organized we are as a party, the better the outcome. We believe in the ideals of equality and democracy, freedom of thought and religion. We rally around the notion that we are all bound together and a belief that civil argument can lead us to a more perfect union. We commit ourselves to the principles that are embodied in our Constitution. And we have to remember that our faith is tested at hard times, not at easy times. That‚Äôs how this works. So I hope all of us‚Äîas citizens, as volunteers, as Americans who simply believe that we can make this country better‚Äîare ready to get marching, get organizing, and get voting. It‚Äôs up to us."
Every time I leave Chicago, I leave with a little more hope. Over the years, I‚Äôve made some pretty remarkable memories here, and today we added one more at the @ObamaFoundation Summit. Hearing the stories of the young people shaping our future has reaffirmed for me that there‚Äôs no challenge we can‚Äôt overcome.
I came to Chicago in my 20s, still trying to figure out who I was. It was there that I found my community and my purpose. Excited to be back here for the @ObamaFoundation Summit to hear some remarkable stories from folks around the world‚Äîand share my own. I hope you‚Äôll tune in at obama.org
Samantha Power is a Pulitzer Prize winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. And from my campaign through all eight years of my presidency, she was a key voice on my foreign policy team. In her highly personal and reflective memoir, The Education of an Idealist, she grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy and governance. It‚Äôs a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.
The Pacific has always been a part of me. Growing up in Hawai ªi and Indonesia, with the guidance of my mother and grandparents, I learned to appreciate the wonders and beauty of the region. During my time in elected office and in the years since, I saw the many ways that the Asia-Pacific region has positioned itself to take advantage of tremendous opportunities. It‚Äôs home to a remarkable generation of emerging leaders, women and men poised to take on some of the greatest challenges our planet has ever faced. Earlier this year, I had a chance to meet with a few of these folks as we designed the @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific program. And today, I‚Äôm excited to say that Michelle and I will be joining the program‚Äôs inaugural gathering in Malaysia in December. We‚Äôll talk about the importance of ethical leadership‚Äîhow staying true to your values is the only way to truly carry out lasting change. I couldn‚Äôt be prouder of all the leaders selected to join this program‚Äîall the work they‚Äôve already accomplished, and all the good work that is yet to come.
As President, I leaned on @ambsusanrice‚Äôs experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you‚Äôll see why. It‚Äôs a tribute to American leadership‚Äîand a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you‚Äôll read it.
Like the Beatles said: It‚Äôs getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years!
"Meet William Lucas from Durham, North Carolina. He answered the call when @allontheline asked engaged citizens to come to the state capitol and share their opinions about the legislature‚Äôs court-mandated redraw. He showed up, urging lawmakers to go about their business fairly, explaining the ways that gerrymandered maps have hurt his community. 
If we‚Äôre going to win the fight for fair voting districts‚Äînot just in North Carolina but all across the country‚Äîwe need more folks to follow William‚Äôs lead. Join @allontheline and help lead the fight for fair voting maps. Sign the citizen commitment at the link in my bio."
On National Voter Registration Day, it‚Äôs up to us as citizens to make sure everyone we know can make their voices heard at the ballot box. Check and update your registration at the link in my bio ‚Äî and tell your friends, too.
At just 16 years old, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet‚Äôs greatest advocates. Her age might have something to do with it. With full knowledge that her generation will bear the heaviest burden of climate change, she‚Äôs unafraid to believe that progress is possible‚Äîand fight for real change. She‚Äôs an example of why Michelle and I started the @ObamaFoundation ‚Äî because we believe in a future that‚Äôs shaped by the courage and hope of young people like Greta.

These 4 exercises with light hand weights will give you more muscle üí™üèª for your hustle! Watch the full video üìπ or swipe‚¨ÖÔ∏èto see each exercise.
‚†Ä 
I took these 4 from my newest class Fit to the CORE out on Monday. ‚û°Ô∏èI love incorporating light hand weights into Pilates core work for a full body üî• burn.
‚†Ä 
Video 1:
Pilates Cross Crawl (optional weights). If you are using weights, make sure to be carful of the neck and shoulders. If you feel any pulling, set the head down or don‚Äôt use the weights. This exercise works the deep core and adding weights work the shoulders as well!
‚†Ä 
Video 2: 
Hollow Body Press. Again optional weight however the weight will add an inner thigh component that you don‚Äôt get without the weight. Support the neck with the hands or lay the head down on the floor.
‚†Ä 
Video 3: 
Flying Tiger. I love this exercise so much because it really does require you to focus and use the Transverse Abs to stay stable. The shoulder and the tricep get a nice burn as well as the hamstrings! So amazing!
‚†Ä 
Video 4:
Hydrant Plank Ups. Another awesome simple exercise with a surprise! Add the weight to the back of the knee for a nice hamstring burn. Add the hydrant to your dog and you are working into Glute medius then finish it off with knee to tricep to work the abs, shoulders, and Psoas!

1. Knee to chest holds - works arms and core strength while building endurance. This is 1/2 the battle!

2. Leg lifts over a block - works the Psoas and lengthens the hamstrings. Yes, it burns like crazy!üî• 3. Leg Lift with Side Squat- this are so good!üíÉüèºWorks the mobility of the hip and also challenges the core. Use a block under the hip to modify!

3. Single Leg ups - more burning üî• but you can modify by leaning back a bit and not straightening the leg as far.

4. Block kicks! üü¶ These are my favorite! Active range flexibility here! Works everything while you focus on scoring that goal ü•Ö between your hands!

"When I was diagnosed with #Fibromyalgia, the doctor looked at me and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, we have wonderful pain killers these days ...‚Äù I was only 23 years old.
‚†Ä 
He went on to tell me that I have an ‚Äúoveractive nervous system‚Äù and ‚Äúmore nerve endings in my body‚Äù which is why I am so sensitive to the touch. He also told me ‚Äúthere is no cure and I‚Äôd always have pain.‚Äùüòî
‚†Ä
In a way however, this made me feel validated because growing up I never wanted anyone to touch me and even the slightest bump or bruise felt like I got run over by a truck.
‚†Ä 
But ugh, I didn‚Äôt want to take pain killers ... I hated feeling groggy and out of it. There had to be another way.
‚†Ä 
My personality is such that if you tell me ‚Äúthere is no cure‚Äù, I‚Äôll prove you wrong or at least make a concerted effort.ü§ì
‚†Ä 
So that is what I did... I began my search (& study) of how to heal myself.
‚†Ä 
My search lead me to something miraculous. It‚Äôs called the mind-body connection and it absolutely changed my life.
‚†Ä 
All those feelings of not being good enough, bitterness, resentment and stress ... they were causing my ‚Äúoveractive nervous system‚Äù to be on high alert. My body stored negative emotion like a sponge and the end result was body pain, migraines and exhaustion.
‚†Ä 
I learned that my ‚Äúsensitivity‚Äù is actually a gift when I use it mindfully.üßòüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I learned that controlling stress, controls my symptoms and most importantly, I found out that being gentle and kind to myself is more powerful than any drug I could take.
‚†Ä 
It‚Äôs taken me over 20 years to finally arrive at this place in my life, but I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. I now have the pleasure of sharing with others how to connect inward. I teach people through yoga and Pilates how to listen to their body, release stress & feel amazing!
‚†Ä 
I help others, no matter what they are going through, learn to be gentle and kind to themselves.üôèüèª

"üî•4 #CORE exercises using a block that will train your deep abs (TVA). Bookmark üîñ and TAG a friend!
‚†Ä 
Do you know how to active your deep core muscles?
‚†Ä 
Do you know why it‚Äôs so important?
‚†Ä 
Our deep abdominals help to stabilize our spine and protect our organs. They also help relay messages from the brain to our limbs.
‚†Ä 
If you only train just what people can see (6 pack abs) you will be doing yourself a disservice not to mention missing out!!
‚†Ä 
Test how weak (or strong) your core actually is!
‚†Ä 
TAKE THE TEST
Balance a block on your knee and perform these 4 exercises:
‚†Ä 
Video 1: Side Plank with leg extension. Place the block on the hip bone (the highest point of balance) and try to perform the movement. Keep abs engaged and body completely still as you move the leg.
‚†Ä 
Video 2: Open and close the hip. Place the block on opposite knee. If TVA (transverse abs) is not engage, block will fall immediately. Try to do as many as you can slow and controlled on both sides. Low back should maintain contact with the floor throughout.
‚†Ä 
Video 3: Leg Raises.  Place block on opposite knee. Move through your full range of motion here without dropping the block. Low back stays flat in the ground.
‚†Ä 
Video 4: Leg Raise + Twist. Same as video 3 but this time we will test your ability to rotate. Keep abs in tight abs move through this without losing the block.üòÖ
‚†Ä 
If your able to do 10 or more on each side, congratulations, your deep abs are working!üëèüèª
‚†Ä 
If not, now you know where to start!üôåüèª

‚†Ä 
Adding a simple band to your #athomeworkouts will not only help you with muscle tone but also help you engage the deep core muscles!
‚†Ä 
Video 1:
LEAN BACK W/Tricep extension
Tips: keep the back straight. Draw navel in and don‚Äôt let the back arch or butt stick out. Exhale on the lean back as you extent the arm straight to work the tricep. These burn so go slowly ... pace yourself.üëçüèª
‚†Ä 
Video 2:
SCISSOR ‚úÇÔ∏è
Tips: your head can stay down and band can be around thighs to modify. You want to pull top leg in as you pull bottom leg away. Works #Psoas and #hamstring while working core like crazy.üôåüèª
‚†Ä 
Video 3:
DOWN DOG PULL
Tips: hook band around soles of the feet and exhale as you pull knee to tricep. These sneak up on you so be warned.üòÖ
‚†Ä 
Video 4:
BRIDGE UPS
Tips: place band around knee and sole of the foot as you lift hips up and bring opposite knee in. These will fire up the glutes like never before.üçëüî•

Happy bday daddy . . .
I recently took a photo trip to a well known location. One of those places where the map shows a little friendly camera icon.  I raced along with focused intent, anxious to arrive, hoping to catch evening light. But once there, I couldn‚Äôt convince myself to take any pictures. Feeling an impending sense of failure, I camped for the night. The next morning, aimlessly starting for home, I snapped a few photos along the way, just random things, small fascinations. Before long I found myself in full photo mode. Excitedly spinning u turns, hopping in and out with the tripod. Mid day light in the middle of nowhere.
I love going into the backcountry with loose intentions. Maybe I‚Äôll climb that peak, maybe I‚Äôll get some photos, maybe I‚Äôll stay a few more nights.
Floating about Idaho. A friend recently requested a cloud image for a project she was working on. They‚Äôre fun to make, and I was happy to have the excuse. Funny how it captures my summer too, a back to school paragraph, the gist of it, or at least the shadow is, sliding up and down sage hills, racing after distant floating things. Sometimes we‚Äôre just cats chasing laser beams, and that‚Äôs alright by me.
On a long enough time scale, everything is fluid.
"Holotropic. .
A while back on a sunny Sunday, I was stuck inside, injured and immobile, frustrated to say the least. Wondering if oxygen might help the healing, I started breathing, deep and full, and kept breathing that way, for a long while. Much more air than needed. What ended up happening was one of the more unique experiences of consciousness I can remember.  Partly because it was so unexpected. At first alarming, then beautiful. Apparently, as I learned years later, it‚Äôs a thing. The term Holotropic was coined by psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, and his method, which i‚Äôd stumbled into proximity of, was developed in the 1970‚Äôs after LSD was made illegal. Humans have been breathing for a while, so I‚Äôm guessing he wasn‚Äôt the first.
.
One of the perceptual changes I experienced was feeling, (not really seeing, but sensing) everything as tho made of vibrating particles. Like everything was made of sand, but in motion like the static on an old tv. The varying groups of particles held together by consciousness. I looked at my chair, that stout character, and marveled that I didn‚Äôt fall through to the floor. I thanked my cup for holding tea, laughed with the silver physio ball across the room, and cried when conversing with the injured part of my body. Then it was over, and I was laughing again, bemused and wondering what just happened."
"Travel without leaving.
.
This image is another experiment, constructed mostly out of a few small rocks and spray paint. The clouds are from Alaska.
.
I‚Äôm continuing to be fascinated by the idea of proactive vs reactive consciousness.  That we have the power to experience whatever feelings we want, independent of external conditions, or locations, simply through our choice of thoughts. In part, that‚Äôs what these scale experiments are about for me. If you want to feel a sense of awe you can really cultivate that anywhere. Yes, ‚ÄúThe mountains are calling‚Äù but so are small rocks. Perhaps Calvin and Hobbes said it best. ‚ÄúMagic is everywhere.‚Äù"
Color fascinates me. Just like music, our sense perception is related to vibration and velocity. Why does our nervous system react to wavelengths in such distinct emotional ways.
Going, and through.
"The conversations of passing formations. 
Halfway through a day long drive, I took a nap in the shade on the bench of a roadside picnic table. Clouds and trains whispered by on distant tracks of thought. Formations toward destinations, some on their way, and some already there."
One of my favorite Mountains, deconstructed and reconstructed in about 20 photos. I love playing with the interaction of shapes, the notan of light and dark. The time spent observing and the possibility of seeing something new. The closeness felt to a place I love. Only in retrospect, is there consideration of meaning, of audience perception, of the expectations within photography. Is this no longer real? Would that question exist in painting? What is real? Are memories only true when viewed in sequence, correctly delineated in the space of time? Can something imagined contain truth? Hemingway talked a lot about capital T truth, and he wrote fiction. Picasso pioneered cubist art, multiple perspectives shown simultaneously, searching for a deeper truth. I certainly look up to them in artistic admiration. (Regardless of their personal issues.) We seem to live in a crazy time when it comes to the collision of agreed upon realities. Perhaps intention is the most important part.
"The Great Inland Sea. A favorite of mine from the @Hasselblad book project last spring.
.
It‚Äôs a meta-scape of sorts. A landscape about the landscape, patterns repeated, mountains and waves, altered in scale or frozen in form."
Dragons tail. Walking in the woods, you find a small interesting branch. Following along, the branch winds and curves, it appears to be covered in scales of fascination. Your head is down, you focus intently, your excitement grows, the branch grows. You follow faster and faster. Silver spikes, what is this?! A dragon of course. Also, the creative process.

Buat cowok, ceritain di comment di bawah tentang pengalaman ngerawat kulit wajah atau cerita aja kenapa kamu yang harus menang buat ngedapetin paket TBS Men's Product di atas!‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
Buat cewek, sama, ceritain juga di comment, tapi sekalian MENTION/sebut buat siapa kamu pengen kasih TBS Men's Product di atas! Misal buat kakak/adek/pacar/om/ayah/kakek dll!‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£

"#TheMoreYouKnow - Bikin Podcast cuma 5 menit, auto masuk Spotify.‚Å£
‚Å£
Netijen yang budiman, meskipun gue udah beberapa kali koar-koar tentang podcast, tapi netijen tetep aja banyak yang nanya gimana caranya bikin podcast, sekarang gue kasi tau lagi di sini ya. Singkat padat jelas üî•‚Å£
‚Å£
Gue bikin podcast cuma modal microphone, rekam suara pake smartphone-pun udah oke. Abis itu gue upload suaranya pake aplikasi Anchor (bisa via web, atau app, ada di App Store/Playstore). Nah si @anchor.fm ini gratis, jadi setelah kita upload podcast kita, Anchor akan otomatis ngedistribusiin podcast kita ke berbagai platform seperti Spotifyüéπ‚Å£
‚Å£
Di Anchor juga banyak tersedia backsound-backsound kalo bingung mau kasih lagu apa biar ga kesepian podcastnya üéô‚Å£
‚Å£
Buat yang mau sharing-sharing atau bikin konten, Podcast adalah salah satu cara paling effortless. Nggak perlu pikirin visual. Mau sambil tiduran, sambil mandi, nyuci baju, atau live report, tinggal rekam, upload, terus ajak temen-temen dengerin di Anchor/SpotifyüíÉüèªüï∫üèª‚Å£
‚Å£
Buat yang udah berhasil bikin podcast atau udah punya podcast, share nama podcastnya di komen ya!! üëçüèªüî•‚Å£

Kalo gue biasa nyari film aja sih kalo lagi ada waktu senggang, kalo Ibu Ubi biasanya cari acara-acara masak, kalo Zayka, kita cariin tontonan yang edukatif. Biasanya sih, yang jadinya belajar nggak cuma Zayka, tapi sekeluarga jadi ikutan belajar juga bareng Zayka (biar kalo Zayka nanya bisa jawab üëÄ)‚Å£

"Leani ‚ÄúNikki‚Äù Auxilio | 1992 - 2019

I first met Nikki when her mother Marivir used to take care of Mateo. That was ten years ago. 
Nikki came to live with us half of the week and work in our studio for over a year. She ate dinner with us. Cooked with us. Sometimes washed dishes with us. 
We tried to ween her off instant ramen noodles, but it was to no avail. We would sit around the table and see who could burp loudest. 
Nikki. Who knew the most useless facts about anime. 
Nikki.
Mateo and KK would endlessly ruin the endings of Marvel movies for her. But she didn‚Äôt seem to care. 
If the boys were too insane she zoned them out and played one of those innumerable massive multiplayer iPhone games. Like candy crush on steroids with an anime twist. 
There is all this office detritus that has Nikki‚Äôs hands all over it - small post it notes with her even smaller handwriting and doodles framing a few words of work still to be done. Wires from phones I don‚Äôt own. 
A book on how to spark revolution with baking soda.  Or something like that. 
Last year we took a cardboard table home from a photo event. Was sat it in our living room. And over weeks Nikki and all of us continued to draw on it with every pen and marker and crayon we had. Random doodles. Little characters. It‚Äôs was Nikki. To seeing the spark of creation in her pen. To see her hand bring to life her imagination. 
And that isn‚Äôt gone. That spark is still alive in all the people she has touched. In all the drawings she crafted.  It is In the love she had for everyone. 
The spark that drove her towards social justice.

There is a poem written about a  WWII resistance fighter who died fighting for her beliefs at the age of 23 that I thought would be appropriate.

There are stars whose radiance is visible on earth
though they have long been extinct.
There are people whose brilliance continues to light
the world even though they are not longer among the living‚Ä¶."

Lions may be the top predators out in the African savannah, but size definitely matters as well. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to retreat... #bigcats #lions #okavangolions #botswana #elephant #movealong #retreat #wildlife #photography #africa #savannah
"We are both thrilled and honored to share the magic, wonder, and importance of African wildlife and conservation through our new feature film, Okavango: River of Dreams (Directors Cut) at the 2020 @sundancefestival Much of the film features the landscapes and wildlife that we have spent our lives working in. Congratulations to all the other filmmakers in the 2020 Sundance Film Festival

"It‚Äôs a wonderful tradition to give thanks and turn your mind from the pressures of the everyday to those magical moments, days and incidents whose shine gets brighter the more you focus on them.
I‚Äôm thankful to be here of course. The rigours of the buffalo attack have faded and my health has returned but that moment of life and death could easily have slipped into death had it not been for @dereckjoubert who would never give up on me. 
I‚Äôm so thankful to be able to spend my time back in the African bush with even more love for it and determination to do good by it and by the people who live out here together with wildlife and look towards the best way forward for man and beast. 
I‚Äôm thankful that the #RhinosWithoutBorders project is doing so well and we have welcomed dozens of babies ‚Äì born into a safer environment and I‚Äôm so thankful that so many people are supporting this and keeping them safe. 
There are many stresses on our wild places and their inhabitants and it‚Äôs easy to get bogged down in the challenges. But there are also so many talented and dedicated people who are working non-stop to ensure that wild places remain wild, that people and predators can co-exist, that people and elephants can live in harmony. And there are more and more people who are seeing the benefits of keeping the wilds wild as photographic tourists flock and jobs are created and the land remains more resilient to drought. 
For these things ‚Äì and so many more, I am so very thankful. 
#HappyThanksgiving"
Hippos are such important animals in environments like the Okavango. Not only do they create pathways through thick vegetation and reeds, but they help to maintain short grass lawns which are nutrient-rich and easily grazed by other animals. Birds love them too and stick close by while they disturb hordes of tasty insects... #keystonespecies #hippo #okavango #everythingislinked #botswana #megaherbivore #africa #wildlife #photography #upwiththesun #dawn
A herd moves through the wide open landscape of Duba Plains. Elephants on this Okavango island know that there is no threat to them from the few camera-wielding tourists, and their calm curiosity allows for wonderful, close moments with them. #thejoyofelephants #okavango #thisismytrophy #elephants #botswana #dubaplains #africa #wildlifephotography #matriarch #megaherbivore

Ecosystems will tell you the stories of their inhabitants through trails and the shaping of vegetation.  Each species has an effect, although some are more evident than others. Hippos and elephants create paths through vegetation that others can follow, while tiny termites can help to create small island mounds, rich with trees and a dry refuge from high water. Unfortunately, our species‚Äô own footprint tends to be rather more obvious and much less green... #aerial #okavango #ecosystems #everythingislinked #botswana #wildlifetrails #keystonespecies #aerialphotography #landscapephotography #botswana
Dawn in the African bush; a cacophony of bird song, botanical scents, endless hues and if you're lucky, a patrolling predator.... #bigcats #thisismytrophy #okavangolions #lrf #lion #dawn #wildlife #photography #savannah #golden #upwiththesun #bestpartoftheday #Africa
When looking at big cats  we may associate play with young animals learning essential skills that will be necessary in later life. But with lions, the unusually social cats, games of chase will stay into adulthood and keep those social bonds tight. #bigcats #lions #okavangolions #botswana #chaseme #africa #wildlife #photography #animalbehavior #thisismytrophy #play

"Essa semana alguns consumidores apresentaram irritabilidade quando utilizaram a L√°grima e a Bruma Rose Gold, formando vermelhid√£o e ardor. Hoje passamos o dia numa reuni√£o entre mim, a marca @payotbrasil e todos os envolvidos. Eles atenderam ao meu pedido de recolher todos os lotes do mercado para preservar a seguran√ßa do meu p√∫blico e eliminar qualquer desconforto. Um caso desse jamais seria ignorado por mim e pela minha equipe. Eu pe√ßo perd√£o a todos que tiveram essa rea√ß√£o, meu maior est√≠mulo √© quando vejo algu√©m se surpreendendo positivamente com o meu trabalho, me entristeceu ver alguns v√≠deos com pessoas que sofreram essa irritabilidade.

Caso algu√©m que esteja lendo esse comunicado, tenha algum desses produtos apresentando irritabilidade e n√£o souber  o que fazer, entre em contato com o SAC da @payotbrasil que eles ir√£o te atender com toda aten√ß√£o e cuidado. 
√â importante salientar que em todos os produtos¬†da linha Boca Rosa Beauty¬†PELE, foram realizados¬†testes de seguran√ßa e hipoalergenicidade.¬†S√£o testes realizados¬†em laborat√≥rios credenciados pela Anvisa/Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de, com metodologias r√≠gidas e¬†absolutamente confi√°veis. Esses testes certificam que utilizamos as mat√©rias-primas nas quantidades recomendadas e que n√£o utilizamos ativos alerg√™nicos. A conclus√£o do teste para os dois produtos foi de que ‚Äún√£o induziu fen√¥menos irritativos ou de sensibiliza√ß√£o cut√¢nea e n√£o provocou fotossensibiliza√ß√£o e nem¬†fototoxicidade significativos detect√°veis durante o per√≠odo de estudo, sendo considerados seguros para uso t√≥pico,¬†suportando desta forma o termo¬†dermatologicamente testado e hipoalerg√™nico."" Esses produtos retirados ser√£o substitu√≠dos por novos lotes, que ser√£o testados novamente, inclusive com enfoque em peles sens√≠veis.

Mais uma vez quero me desculpar em meu nome e tamb√©m em nome da @payotbrasil que sempre foram sol√≠citos e atenciosos com todo o meu p√∫blico desde o in√≠cio da nossa parceria. Estamos trabalhado para que tudo seja resolvido logo. 
Obrigada a todos pela compreens√£o."

I was the one who had to take the Thanksgiving photo, but I fixed it after.

STORY TIME: The other day I stumbled behind the counter of a fish market to try and scrounge for some fish heads in the dumpster. It was then that the owner of the place caught me. His name was Captain Winslow. Instead of setting the dogs on me, Winslow decided to test me by having me catch a fish. I was as nervous as a field mouse in a den of snakes, but by Neptune‚Äôs trident, I caught the slippery son of a gun. It was then that Winslow decided that I have what it takes, so he gave me a job full time working at the fish market for ten cents an hour (before taxes). I hope this story has inspired you to follow your dreams, and hopefully one day you too will catch your fish.

Rediscovering my roots in Vietnam üõ∂ I did not expect the start of my trip to be as frustrating and stressful as it‚Äôs been. Why? Because I can barely communicate in a language that I grew up speaking. Here‚Äôs the thing with being born a child of an immigrant parent in the US - you live a double life. At home, you eat your cultural foods and you speak your mother and father‚Äôs native language. But when you go to school, you need to be as American as you can be so that the other kids won‚Äôt make fun of you, your parents‚Äô thick accent, or the smelly food you like to eat. So in a way, I‚Äôve unconsciously pushed away my Vietnamese heritage. What a stupid thing to do - to want to be like everyone else - to want to blend in and be same. Yet I can‚Äôt blame my child self for doing that because I get it...I get wanting to fit in. So now all I can do is reclaim my heritage by slowly relearning my language and embracing the culture and the country that my parents grew up in. It‚Äôs been a lovely adventure over here, and so wonderful to be able to speak a little more and learn a little more each day from my grandparents. üëµüèºüßìüèº Did anyone else grow up feeling this double identity? #blogilates
What‚Äôs your sign? I‚Äôm a Capricorn! ‚ôëÔ∏è Today is the launch day for my brand new @popflex_active collection, the #ConstellationCollection! üåå From these high waisted 7/8 leggings with a scalloped hem to a sports bra with a POCKET (omg!!!!) - it‚Äôs my fave release to date. Also I‚Äôm so happy to tell you that we‚Äôve officially launched sizes XS-3X (2-22) in this Zodiac set right here!!! It‚Äôs a test to see how this size range sells, and if y‚Äôall are eating it up, we‚Äôre gonna charge forward with the XS-3X range for all styles moving forward. I hope you love this collection guys.

Everyone at the matcha cafe ordered one dessert and shared. @samlivits and I ordered 3 and shared. üòõ Many of you have been wondering how I‚Äôve been doing since the end of my 90 day journey and if I‚Äôve been able to maintain my weight. The answer is yes, I have. But with fluidity. There‚Äôs days where I lose weight, days where I gain weight, and days where I stay exactly the same! I‚Äôve experimented more with my food and I can with 100% confidence tell you that grains bloat me, the combination of dairy and sugar makes my skin inflame almost immediately (while we were eating this, Sam told me a pimple was developing around my mouth), and excessive calories make me gain fat and weight. These are cold hard FACTS about my body. Powered with this knowledge, I know exactly what I‚Äôm getting into when I get into it. When I make the decision to eat something, there is no feeling bad because my desire to eat it outweighs the consequences! Like, I will GLADLY eat a matcha crepe cake, a matcha cheesecake, and a matcha milkshake boba topped with matcha ice cream, corn flakes and a butter cookie on vacation - even if it means bumpy, red skin the next day. However, if I knew I had a photo shoot or video shoot that week, no, I would not make that decision. Food is fluid. Your body is fluid. Your decisions should be fluid too. Remember, there are seasons for intensity and seasons for relaxation. #blogilates #matchalover

Just want to take a moment and congratulate my good friend (and barber) Chris, on 6 years of sobriety! Life ain‚Äôt easy, plain and simple. It tests us. It pokes at our insecurities. It has joyful highs and pressuring lows. But these experiences become a part of you. They‚Äôre that healed scar you become proud to show. A couple pages out of the long story we write, that is US. And we never really know what the next page holds but that‚Äôs what makes life, life. It‚Äôs yours. You own it and have to own what comes with that responsibility. It can be just as scary as it is exciting. Just as sad as it is happy. But those experiences are meant for you. We go through shit, we learn, we respond, we get stronger, we share that energy with the universe and keep moving forward. Thank you @no_class_in_first_class for being an example of that and inspiring me to continue chasing a better version of myself daily. #cashonly

A harp seal pup about 2 weeks old makes its first swim beneath pack ice while mom watches from behind. Photographed on assignment for @natgeo in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada.
Historically these animals have thrived in this region, where come for a few weeks each year to engage in courtship, mating and pupping. But declining sea ice due to climate change over the last decade has caused problems for this species for without stable ice, the pups cannot suckle from their moms and may fall into the icy sea before they are physically prepared. Survival for this species is uncertain if these trends continue.

A Humpback whale calf plays alongside its resting mom in the waters of the South Pacific. Humpback moms invest a lot into their offspring, with a gestation that lasts nearly a year and then spends the first year of the calf‚Äôs life teaching it all the skills it will need to survive in the sea. These bonds are strong and are an important element of whale culture. 
It is a privilege to be in the water and experience a scene like this. The tenderness and depth of feeling between mom and calf is palpable. Our planet is filled with such moments, we simply have to look ...

A humpback whale fills it gigantic mouth with herring and seawater in the chilly waters of the Norwegian Arctic. This whale surprised me in the dimly lit water, rocketing up from below, its mouth agape. The humpback‚Äôs throat pleats expand, allowing lots of fish and water to be taken inside. The water is pushed out through the baleen and only the fish remain.

My portrait of a Gray Seal in the Gulf of Maine, entitled ‚ÄòAin‚Äôt Misbehaving,‚Äô is now available in beautiful large format as a limited edition, signed and numbered fine art print! Available only from the @focus_gallery_chatham in Chatham, Massachusetts. 
To see the full collection of my prints at the Focus Gallery, follow the link in my profile.

This has always been one of my favorite images. I was diving off Acadia National Park in Maine and spent 5 hours in the chilly water the day I made this picture, loving every minute of being with these seals. In the beginning they were shy, but eventually built up their courage to come closer and eventually were biting on my fins! This guy stoped just long enough for me to make one picture, then swam off.

A beluga whale poses perfectly for this portrait the chilly waters off of Nova Scotia, Canada. Belugas are a highly social species, often called the ‚Äòcanaries of the sea‚Äô for their diverse repertoire of whistles, clicks and other sounds. They are also known to mimic sounds that they hear, including boat engines and other sounds.
Though these gorgeous creatures live in the Arctic, they frequently move into Sub-Arctic waters as well. They are one of the only whale species capable of turning their necks in all directions.

A sperm whale mom lies upside down beneath the surface as her new calf nurses in the waters of the Eastern Caribbean Sea. Portrayed as monsters for centuries, researchers today know that these animals and their societies are far more complex than ever believed. To sperm whales, families are very important. They are led by older, wise females that make decisions for the family unit.

In the time that I have spent with these animals, I have been amazed at their tenderness to one another. Most of their lives are spent in the deep, dark and cold sea and it seems that they truly relish these social gatherings in shallow water. I have observed what can only be described as joy when they socialize with each other.

A Humpback whale calf swims above its mom as two male escorts follow along in the waters off the Cook Islands. They had spent a few days in the shallow, protected waters around the islands and were now heading out to open sea. Humpback moms invest a lot into their offspring, with a gestation that lasts nearly a year and then spends the first year of the calf‚Äôs life teaching it all the skills it will need to survive in the sea. These bonds are strong and are an important element of whale culture. This population of humpbacks feed in Antarctic waters during the summer, then migrate to the South Pacific in winter  to have their calves. 
Being allowed into the world of these animals is a privilege and never ceases to be exhilarating for me! Coverage from my on going project for @natgeo

In late November the ‚ÄòPolar Night‚Äô occurs, with weeks on end of darkness. Successful feeding by the orca involves complex communications and echolocation.

A Humpback Whale calf lifts its head out of the water to have a a look at me as it swims past my boat in the waters of the South Pacific. This calf‚Äôs mom spent the summer in Antarctica, feeding in those rich and chilly waters, then migrated to the warm waters of the South Pacific to give birth. Humpback moms invest a great deal in their offspring, with a gestation period that last about a year and during the first year of the calf‚Äôs life, mom teaches it the things it will need to know to survive. Research shows that humpback mothers even‚Äô whisper‚Äô to their calves in places where predators might otherwise hear them.

I put together this chic outfit using LOFT's super comfortable Ponte Leggings and I think it's safe to say these are a game-changer for anyone who works in an office! They look super professional but feel like you're wearing your cozies at home. The rest of my look is from LOFT too, including my statement earrings, which I always love to add something extra! ;) You can shop everything in the liketoknow.it app or on BTD! #loveloft‚Å£

"Well friends, I'm officially 30! Yep, my birthday was on Friday and I have to say,  I'm really grateful to be going into this decade. I know aging can be weird and scary but it's also so cool and such a privilege!

Pumps? Sling backs? Ribbon tied around my ankle? Rhinestones/crystals? Lace? Velvet?! It‚Äôs all SO FUN! Basically, ANYTHING is possible! These are just starting points to help us get thinking!

It‚Äôs not a ‚Äòperfect‚Äô photo, but it says a lot. Little wind-burnt but in my happy place, with all the smiles. While hiking with @vanessafraser the other day we chatted a lot about Instagram and how things have changed for us over the years. I think we took three photos on this hike and instead spent it catching up and trying not to blow off the ridge with the intense winds. I also made a story post the other day asking yal for feedback on ‚Äòcurated‚Äô versus raw, unedited stories and how I feel meant influencers/photographers/bloggers on here are moving to more curated stories & I asked what yal would like to see and I was blown away at the comments and messages back suggesting ‚ÄòKeep doing what I‚Äôm doing‚Äô and how one of the reasons yal follow is because it isn‚Äôt always perfect and it‚Äôs a mix of everyday life as well.

"üáßüá∑üñ§ PRECISAMOS EXIGIR QUE AS AUTORIDADES TOMEM ATITUDES URGENTES. O governo e os √≥rg√£os competentes, assim como institui√ß√µes especializadas, que disp√µe de capital humano e da tecnologia de ponta, dos equipamentos t√©cnicos e do conhecimento necess√°rio, precisam ATUAR IMEDIATAMENTE pra CONTER O AVAN√áO DO PETR√ìLEO e tomar toda e qualquer provid√™ncia pra MINIMIZAR OS DANOS causados ao nosso ecossistema, j√° que N√ÉO √â POSS√çVEL REVERTER TOTALMENTE OS IMPACTOS do derramamento. 
O nosso meio ambiente pode levar D√âCADAS para se recuperar dessa trag√©dia.
J√° s√£o mais de 300 PRAIAS do nordeste CONTAMINADAS pelas manchas de √≥leo.
E pra voc√™ que ainda escolhe ter uma postura tola, 100% pol√≠tica e partid√°ria, radical e infantil diante de uma calamidade destas, saiba que a contamina√ß√£o do petr√≥leo n√£o fica apenas na superf√≠cie. Parte do petr√≥leo se dissolve na √°gua, assim contaminando os animais marinhos podendo CONTAMINAR TODA A CADEIA ALIMENTAR da qual N√ìS fazemos parte. 
Repensou agora? 
O Brasil, e principalmente os governos estaduais e munic√≠pios claramente N√ÉO TEM PREPARO E ESTRUTURA para lidar com um vazamento de √≥leo desse tamanho e o atual governo age com DESCASO e prefere apontar dedos do que decretar ESTADO DE EMERG√äNCIA e executar as a√ß√µes necess√°rias num momento grave como este, incluindo buscar e aceitar ajuda de qualquer outro pa√≠s. Corremos o risco de derramamento de √≥leo durante TODO O PROCESSO de explora√ß√£o do petr√≥leo e nesse caso, ainda nem sabemos o local de origem do vazamento, muitos menos as causas e o tamanho desse derramamento. 
Os combust√≠veis f√≥sseis s√£o a PRINCIPAL RAZ√ÉO DO AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL. Precisamos falar mais sobre isso, repensar diariamente a maneira em que os usamos e pressionar as autoridades e √≥rg√£os competentes no mundo todo. N√£o √© mimimi, muito menos tem a ver com posi√ß√£o pol√≠tica. Escrevo isso tamb√©m como forma de lembrete pra mim. N√≥s realmente PRECISAMOS ACELERAR A TRANSI√á√ÉO PRA UMA MATRIZ ENERG√âTICA 100% LIMPA E RENOV√ÅVEL.
N√£o. Existe. Planeta. B. 
Ao povo nordestino e a todos os volunt√°rios, a minha eterna gratid√£o. O MUNDO est√° vendo que VOC√äS est√£o limpando o √≥leo do nosso mar no bra√ßo. OBRIGADA. (Continua nos coment√°rios)"

"Kemarin aku dan Ansara hadir di #MYBABYMomversity. Acaranya bikin Ansara bisa cobain banyak arena permainan yang seru banget dan ikut kelas MY BABY Lovely Spa. Acara ini dipersembahkan oleh @mybabyid sebagai wadah untuk Ibu menambah ilmu agar makin menikmati perannya, mulai dari cara pijat bayi yang benar, olahraga sama anak, serta mengajarkan Ibu dalam mengatur keuangan. Bermanfaat sekali! Terima kasih MY BABY untuk ilmu serta keseruannya üòä
#MYBABYMomversity"
Walaupun kadang susah, tapi aku membiasakan untuk percaya sama Ansara ketika dia mau mengeksplorasi lingkungan baru. Memang sih deg-degan takut dia jatuh atau kepentok, tapi kalaupun jatoh atau kepentok kan dia jadi belajar kalau memang harus lebih memperhatikan kemana dia jalan dan jadi lebih bisa mengenal kapasitas dirinya. Tapi tetep selau dalam pengawasan ya, jadi Ansara juga merasa aman setiap melihat reaksi atau respon Ibunya yang selalu menyemangati ketika Ia mau mencoba hal yang baru. Kalau kalian bagaimana menghadapi anak yang mau coba segalanya sendiri? #parentingtips #parenting
Ini foto di saat kita masih obsesi banget sama Tante @anggun_cipta , sampai maunya pakai baju ala rocker, rebutan topi dan sepatu boots untuk meniru gayanya. Untung jaket jeans belel-nya kita punya masing-masing. Kalo enggak, mungkin udah rebutan. Gitulah rasanya punya sister yang bedanya cuma 1 tahun (lebih 3 bulan). Selalu jadi temen main, temen curhat, temen rebutan, temen berantem, temen ketawa, temen nangis, and a friend to share many other wonderful things in life you can only understand when you have one. Kalo dulu lagi akur rasanya selalu jadiin Mba Gigi panutan, kalo lagi sebel langsung deh jambak-jambakan üôà Eiiitttss, tapi kalo ada yang berani jambak rambut Mba Gigi sampe dia nangis dan ngadu ke aku, langsung aku samperin dan jambak balik orang itu! ü§£ Agak lebay sih protective-nya, tapi yah waktu itu kan masih belum dewasa cara berpikirnya. Sekarang sih udah banyak kok jalan yang lebih bijak untuk menghadapi bullying. Iya gak? Karena tangan kita cuma 2 buat nutupin ribuan mulut orang yang bisa bicara seenaknya ke kita, tapi hati dan pikiran kita itu cuma kita yang bisa kendalikan. Yakinkan ke diri sendiri bahwa diri kita berarti dan jangan pernah lupa bersyukur. Trik itu membantu aku dalam menjalani keseharian aku yang ga luput dari hate comments and bullying. Kalo mereka ga mikirin dampak omongan mereka kenapa kita harus mikirin mereka? Kalo kalian biasanya gimana menghadapi perundungan atau bullying? Bales atau doain aja? Share dong trik tetep sehat mental menghadapi bullying ala kalian! üòä
"Ansara lagi suka banget sama dunia hewan, mulai dari boneka sampai wujud aslinya. Lagi sering banget Ansara niruin suara-suaranya atau minta main sama binatang peliharaan. 
Kemarin pas Ansara ulang tahun kita nginep di hotel dalam aquarium besar yanh banyak ikan-ikan laut. Memang sih pada dasarnya aku dan Mas @barry.tamin juga suka binatang, jadi membiasakan sayang binatang ga sulit buat kami. Nah, aku mau tau dong #TIPSIbuCerdasMYBABY dari Moms yang lain.

Buruan Ikutan ya Moms!"
Kangen banget jadi petualang kuliner sama Mas @barry.tamin karena sekarang kita diet terus üòÖ Hayo, siapa yang ngiler dan pengen liat #BarryTummyIn lagi? üòÑ
"An adventurous Lil‚Äô Lady ‚ù§Ô∏è Ansara yang lagi ekspresif banget dan suka nyobain hal-hal baru. Biar Ansara lebih tertarik trying new things, biasanya aku atau Mas @barry.tamin ikutan heboh dan seneng cobain duluan depan Ansara. Karena kita percaya banget kalau anak itu pasti lihat reaksi orang tuanya ketika coba hal yang belum familiar. Kalau kitanya happy pasti dia akan lebih percaya diri untuk nyobain dan explore hal yang baru dia kenali. Kadang emang deg-degan sih, tapi aku tetep meyakinkan diri kalau aku harus percaya sama Ansara. Tiap malem juga aku biasain bilang terima kasih ke Ansara udah baik sama Ibu dan ingetin hal-hal baik yang dia lakuin di hari itu. Juga minta maaf kalau Ibu ada salah sama Ansara. Pokoknya Ansara, Ayah @barry.tamin , dan Ibu itu satu team yang harus terus belajar, untuk jadi orang tua dan anak yang lebih baik demi keluarga kita.

Kalau kalian bagaimana? Yuk kita sharing tips parenting yang manjur! Tapi inget ya, tiap keluarga itu berbeda, jadi sharingnya jangan pake emosi, kita ambil baiknya dan kalau ga cocok ga usah dihakimi ‚ò∫Ô∏è #parentingtips #adventurousbabygirl #curiousbaby"

"Tidur yang cukup dan berkualitas itu penting banget buatku untuk menjaga kesehatan. Apalagi akhir-akhir ini kegiatanku super padat. Waktu tidur bareng keluarga jadi momen berharga yang aku tunggu-tunggu.

Sejak aku tambah kasurku dengan #cpro jadi gak repot kalau tiba-tiba Ansara numpahin minuman atau popoknya miring yang menyebabkan kebocoran. Karena kasur @cproid itu waterproof dan mudah dibersihkan. Selain itu, #kasursehat ini didukung dengan teknologi Airmate yang 10 manfaatnya ga bisa kamu temuin di kasur lain. Cek lebih lanjut di akunnya @cproid dan highlights aku ya!"

"Vou confessar: as vezes da uma saudade da franjinha!
E logo atr√°s vemos a minha maestria em matar todas as minhas plantas."
"Os pequenos detalhes importam. Assim como as ‚Äúpequenas‚Äù decis√µes que fazemos todos os dias.
N√£o pense que n√£o se amar por um segundo que seja possa passar batido, porque s√£o as pequenas decis√µes, no dia a dia mesmo, que te fortalecem. 
N√£o importa o que aconteceu ontem, escolha por voc√™ de novo. 
Hoje √© um novo dia! üå∏"

yes hi hello i‚Äôd like to trade places with me from a week ago pls
i‚Äôm posting later than i wanted to but the t-shirt just came in üôèüèΩ today is #latinaequalpay day, when latinas "catch up" to what white, non-latino men were paid in 2018. the gap is widest for latina workers, who on average earn only 54 cents for every $1 a man is paid. meaning they must work nearly two years to earn what white men earn in one year. this is unacceptable, and we need to act now. @phenomenal tee benefits @mujerxsrising, which protects the rights of migrant women. truffle and i are in full support!! #latinapower

This special edition Ford Mustang features the Gulf Heritage livery that were worn by the GT40s that won the 1968 and 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans. It also produces 800 horsepower and hits 60 MPH in just 3.5 seconds. It can be ordered with a manual or automatic transmission, and includes an upgraded suspension, carbon-fiber splitter, Brembo brakes, and a wicker-bill spoiler. A more aggressive track package with a rear wing and upgraded orange wheels is also available. Only 119 will be made in coupe or convertible form for $139,995. Thoughts?
Christmas came early for 13 customers who took delivery of their Porsche 935 at Portimao last week. The Porsche 935 pays tribute to the 935 racecar from the 1970s, and is a track only racecar just like the original 935. The design cues come from the original 935, but with a modern take. It is based off the modern GT2RS with 700 horsepower. Only 77 will be made to celebrate Porsche's 70th birthday. Thoughts on the 935? üì∏ @stephan_bauer
The Dubai police have posted on their Instagram that they will be adding a Cybertruck to their high end lineup of police cars. The 0-60 time of under 3 seconds for the tri motor AWD can definitely be helpful in high speed chases. As well as the 14,000 towing capacity for any police trailers. The Armored body and windows also can shield the car from bullets. Thoughts on this addition to the Dubai police car lineup?
BMW introduced the 3.0 CSL in 1972 as a lightweight homologation special off the 3.0 CS sporting coupe. The CLS weighed approximately 450 pounds lighter than the CS and obtained the nickname Batmobile based off its looks. The aerodynamic package include fins running along the top of the front fenders, a spoiler on the edge of the roof, and a tall rear wing. The rear wing was actually not installed by the factory, as wings were illegal on German roads at the time. It was left in the trunk in three parts for the owner to install. Thoughts? üì∏ @alexpenfold
Volkswagen is headed for the 2020 Baja 1000 with a 480 horsepower Atlas Cross Sport R. The suv coupe almost barely resembles the regular Atlas Cross sport with an open fender and off road design. It is powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 480 horsepower. The truck is still in development, but it will be the first four-wheel-drive machine to race in Baja Class 7 competition. Thoughts?
Nissan and Italdesign design have unveiled the production version of the GT-R50, built to commemorate 50 years of the GTR and Italdesign. Only 50 will be made, with a few available slots left and each are completely customized by the customer. Most of the changes are in the exterior design as the GT-R50 is based off the GTR Nismo. They go for around $1.1. Million each. Thoughts?
The Karma S2 concept is an all electric concept meant to represent the future of the brand. Karma currently only produces the Revero, based on the Fisker. The S2 posts impressive numbers with 1,100 horsepower and a 350 mile range. The most unusual feature of the S2 has to be its "re-live" feature that turns the S2 into a simulator after your last drive and allows you to re-live your last drive to improve your skills. Thoughts?
The new Porsche Speedster can be speced with a heritage look for the extra cash of $24,150. The Heritage design package includes a silver and white livery inspired by the classic Porsche 356 Speedsters which were commonly raced. Only 1948 911 Speedsters will be made in tribute to the year Porsche was found. Thoughts on the Heritage livery? üì∏ @ivanorlov
The 2021 Kia Seltos will be coming to the U.S. for its second year of existence as Kia's rugged looking and roomy SUV. The Seltos offers plenty of headroom and legroom in the front and even rear seats that offer heated and the reclinable seats. The eight-inch or 10.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system runs Kia's UVO system¬†with Android Auto and Apple Car play. Thoughts on this vehicle from Kia?

Dona T√¢nia desde do primeiro dia que tu foi confinada, j√° estava de porta em porta parecendo pol√≠tica pedindo votos pra ti, a mesma que me ligava milh√µes de vezes chorando, dizendo AJUDA MINHA FILHA ela √© o amor da minha vida, MINHA FILHA √â MEU ORGULHO. Nunca fiz um texto t√£o grande, estou me desconhecendo kk, mas f0d@aa-Se, voc√™ foi t√£o minha amiga que quando eu estava errrado ficou ao lado de Lucas, mesmo sendo eu quem te ajuda a ‚Äúcrescer na internet naquele momento ‚Äù foi a√≠ que voc√™ me mostrou o que √© ser justo, falam muito sobre voc√™, geralmente mal.

Thankfully I have them to make me look good ‚ò∫Ô∏è (that‚Äôs the secret btw ü§´). We made an unscheduled stop at the @catmate_ stall to see if they needed a bathroom break, but they were all good.ü§ô The cats are missing all the attention and are being extra affectionate today. We start to head back tomorrow morning, first stopping at @edgarsmission (animal sanctuary) to continue filming several additional animals for a video project I‚Äôve been working on for several months, and may be working on for several more??? Then we head to #Sydney (for a few days) To our followers there, Thursday, CPT Cook Statue (Hyde Park) 3:00 pm meet and greet. Then back home by Sunday. More travel content coming, especially in stories ‚¨ÜÔ∏è that‚Äôs it for now, I‚Äôm taking D n B to the local beach so gotta run. Robert #catloversshow #cats #weeklyfluff #instagram #melbourne and a big THANK YOU to Follower and super generous person @bronnie_walsh for offering her Airbnb to us AND doing a lot of the filming during the event. üëçüëçüëç
We made it. #melbourne üá¶üá∫ for the @thecatloversshow üòä Yes, it would‚Äôve been a lot faster, and less costly to fly with the cats.  Unlike in the US,  where pets can fly inside the cabin, it‚Äôs not allowed here. There is more chance of something frightening them (as cargo) which could have lasting affects. The bottom line is I don‚Äôt like my pets treated like a piece of luggage. Thank you @catmate_ cat litter for sponsoring our road trip. üèÜ#weeklyfluff #catloversshow #cats #catmate

"Being away from Jeb has brought Bindi closer to Didga and myself. üíï @catmantoo ü•∞ Having pets spend time apart was advice I always gave my clients who adopt siblings (or two young pets) at once. Some of the benefits include creating a stronger bond with humans and other pets, plus learning how to cope being apart.

A week of art, palm trees and mental health talks in the books - Saw tons of art, did a tough hot Pilates class (my abs are still sore,) got to chat about burnout (and the long term health effects of it,) finished my fall semester and #ToeGang got to see me in heel sandals. A full week indeed of risks and rewards.
Today was a good day. Thank you @createcultivate for allowing me space to chat about burnout this afternoon. I'm grateful for the space to share what matters most to me - truly helping people to feel better and live more full and calm lives thru understanding mental health and applying it in real world ways. Thanks to everyone who came out! Love y'all long time üïäüïäüïä
Wrote down my goals for 2020 earlier this week and one of them was produce less waste and use even less plastic (already do no plastic bags, but so much else to be mindful of, like water, thank you @drinkeverandever üôèüèΩ) - great panel tonight with @lonelywhale @miamibeachedition at The Museum of Plastic discussing ways to reduce plastic and take way better care of our planet and selves.

A woman and some weights. Not much makes me happier than lifting and feeling strong. It's where I get to focus, feel renewed, appreciate my body for what it can do, and reflect on how many times I've thrown weights around (must be thousands by now, with 2 decades of lifting coming up.) Super excited about December workouts. Any one else look forward to the gym?
Made it thru #thanksgiving and heading to some sunshine üòù
A follower once told me I ‚Äúlooked lonely‚Äù Bc I was in Mexico for thanksgiving vs being with family. Best believe I was not sad lounging in the sun with a margarita that year. The problem with the original assumption is that it plays into the notion holidays are only valuable if spent the way society defines. I will be happily spending time with my family in the ways we dictate work for us this year but there truly are no right or wrong ways to spend a holiday. Holidays can mean whatever you want them to (including nothing at all, I know, unpopular opinion 101 but I champion people dictating what kind of lives they want to live, and being accepting and kind of themselves and others along the way.) I'm really glad boundaries are finally getting popular but I'm more so glad people are finding healing and peace in whatever situations (life and family) they might be in. Currently stocking up on toast options and chugging strong hot tea with a week full of people I love. A good week indeed.
I don't know if younger me knew this level of peaceful contentment was possible. Maybe that's a big part of what this life thing is about, taking all the pieces and parts and experiences, good and bad; then building something younger you would be in awe of.
Someone asked me yesterday what an emotional connection looked like (which I know can be difficult when we are often taught to measure who we love based on a list of external factors, traits, and/or accomplishments) - but an emotional connection (IMO) is one based on seeing and being seen with and by another person. It's a place where you feel safe to be yourself, express yourself, and trust the relationship is not fair-weathered and gives space to grow, change, evolve, and even make mistakes (which all us humans do.) Secure connection is another name for this, and it's one of the things that makes us human; our ability to connect with another and our need for (hello bonding science) or even our longing for connection. üñ§ Happy Friday gang, I'm exhausted but my heart is well.
Simultaneously trying to lift and watch the impeachment hearings. First workout in almost 3 weeks: body is as happy as it is unhappy. But knowing strength comes right back is reassuring.
"Oh hi. Claire here. Been taking some much needed #metime but here are some fun catch up facts:
1) Turned 34 in Oct. and it‚Äôs been amazing. 
2) Haven‚Äôt been to the gym in over 3 weeks and am ok with it. 
3) Did teach a fun yoga class with @coxcommunications tho. 
4) Been on thirteen flights in two weeks. 
5) @vitacoco helps me year-round with hydration, especially when I work out. 
6) Currently seeing clients as part of my final masters work and LMHC licensure process. 
7) Speaking with @createcultivate Vision Summit on Dec.7th - come say hi. 
8) My beloved @moonlitskincare is at @anthropologie now (cop!) 9) Going to sleep at 9:30pm is a game changer. 
10) Making a new book list for all of y‚Äôall as well. 
I hope I can be an example of how much life is lived off these screens and empower all of you to know you're worthy and valid, even if none of it ever gets posted, or hell, any pictures taken.

I‚Äôm very sad to hear my good friend @bradgobright has died in a climbing accident in Mexico.  Besides being an absolutely legendary climber, Brad was an incredibly sweet and earnest human being, who was always a pleasure to be around.  I don‚Äôt have a lot of words right now other than to say that Brad is very missed, and my heart goes out to his friends and family.  I really loved and was inspired by Brad.  He was an exceptional human.
My smart, beautiful, rock crusher wife @nmilfeld has completed a long time dream of free climbing The Free Rider leading every pitch. I got a front row seat supporting her, which entailed...jumaring every pitch with a monster pack, organizing the rope and gear at each belay, massaging her forearms, giving her pep talks, and mostly doing my best impression of a patient human being.  For those of you who have climbed with me, you may know that I get a little antsy once I'm on the wall.  Probably my least supportive moment was on the first enduro corner when I bolstered Nellie with the encouraging words, "you've got to be kidding me," when she botched a gear placement and had to put it back on her harness and select the correct cam...what can I say... I'm a work in progress!  Having free climbed the route twice back in the olden days, first wall style then in a day... I was surprised to remember unhelpfully little about the route... except that you need lots of slings for the sewer pitch... beta I repeated to Nellie with annoying frequency.  Highlights included watching Nellie absolutely style The Monster Offwidth.  Probably the turning point was on day three when Nellie fell off the boulder problem.  She came back down to the anchor and in a moment of anxiety that her dream may be shriveling up,  blurted out the positive affirmation... "I can't do this.. we should just go down." "Oh... there is only one way we are going honey," I assured her, pointing to the summit.  Nellie composed herself and then with a bit of power screaming, fired the crux of the Freerider!  After twenty years climbing in Yosemite, this was one of the best weeks there of my life which started by putting up the best first free ascent I have ever done with @lucho_rivera and then culminated with supporting the love of my life in achieving what will always be one of the greatest, most iconic achievements in rock climbing... free climbing el cap.  So..Here is to Sending!! Here is to my bad ass wife who holds down a full time job as a criminal defense lawyer, while finding time to crush the stone at a professional level!!! Woohooo!  Also.. thanks to @danieljoll for the first top down photo.
Ha!! Oops!  I posted this a no caption!  Go to  @pictures_of_fidelman to purchase the StoneNudes book.  It is epic.  I‚Äôm in there naked... worth the cost alone!
We SENT!!!!! Ten pitches of incredible crack and face climbing that is continuous, outrageous, and gorgeous! @lucho_rivera and I are happy to report there is officially a new hard free route on FiFi Butress and we are calling it ‚ÄúThe Dream Team‚Äù 5.13a.  Of the ten pitches 6 are in the solid 5.12 range and the hardest 2 pitches are right at the top...so for this paragliding pilot... it was a ballistic effort.  By some small miracle It was a no falls day for me except for on the easiest 5.11a pitch where I unexpectedly slipped and flipped upside down with my head missing the belay ledge by about 5 feet! üò¨ It was a short lower to lead the pitch clean!  We are calling the route The Dream Team as a kind of tongue in cheek poke at the fact that Austin, Tommy and Alex managed a new free route on the dawn wall in less time then our much better but much shorter FiFi route... but also because Lucho and I have established some dream routes over the years here in Yosemite, and it really has been an all time climbing partnership for me that has spanned two decades!  We didn‚Äôt have a fancy pro photographer with us... because he was with Alex and Tommy üòúand Now I‚Äôm up on El Cap supporting my lovely wife @nmilfed on The FreeRider... then it‚Äôs a quick turn around to paragliding In Mexico and Chile... but hopefully in the spring we can get some photo and video of what I think is a modern Yosemite Classic! @thenorthface @fattire @fiveten_official @thenorthface_climb
Another shot of @lucho_rivera from our free route in progress... which blazes totally new terrain to the 2/3s height on FiFi where it joins 9-11 established by Dan McDevitt and pioneered for free climbing by our friends Trevor and Margaret who are graciously letting us free the last few pitches of their free project.... if In fact we can accomplish that before nov10 when I head to Oaxaca Mexico and then Chile for  some paragliding adventures!  The route is pretty stacked with 7 or 8 of the 10 pitches being solid 5.12, and one of the last pitches being maybe 5.13.  It‚Äôs going to be a lot to ask of our forearms!  Wish us luck.  It‚Äôs been super awesome to be here in Yosemite which still feels like home after a 3 year break!  @thenorthface @thenorthface_climb @fattire @fiveten_official
For the last couple weeks @lucho_rivera and I have been working on a new free climb on FiFi Buttress here in Yosemite.  Lucho and I have put up some classic first ascents together over the years mostly in Yosemite but also in Malaysia.  While we hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a few years, we picked up right where we left off!  Lucho is a true Yosemite legend, a great first ascent adventure climber who escaped gang life in the bay during his high school years when he discovered Yosemite climbing through a program for troubled youth.  It‚Äôs been refreshing to put down the paraglider  for a bit and get back to the roots.... and routes üòúreconnecting with one of my oldest and best climbing friends and doing what I love to do most In climbing... charging  headlong into unexplored territory!  Right now there is a lot of work to do to get the route ready for a send burn, but it‚Äôs pretty damn stacked with 5 5.12 pitches and one pitch that is probably 13a.... and most importantly the climbing is steep, varied and beautiful.  I think we are putting together a modern classic!  Woohoo!  @thenorthface @fattire @fiveten_official  #neverstopexploring #neverstophanddrilling
Aspiring ski mountaineer and part time nude model @alexhonnold approaches the the gnar gnar in Antarctica.  You probably haven‚Äôt noticed that @thenorthface is launching a new waterproof breathable technology üòú called #FutureLight  or maybe your feed is exploding! Check out my Story for more info.... but the short version is... it‚Äôs a new level in breathable for a waterproof fabric that is soft to the skin!  And even better, it is made from recycled material.  It‚Äôs a good time to be a TNF athlete!!! #neverstopexploring
Photo @jennflemm ...My extraordinary lawyer/climber wife @nmilfeld has red pointed her first 5.13c ...China Doll!  Her ability to excel in both her professional and athletic life is impressive. Just last week she was in the heat of a high stakes criminal trial and this week she clipped the chains on her hardest climb.... a unique linkup! Those who are lucky enough to have Nellie in their life, know her as a sweet and loyal friend who loves her whiskey cocktails, and stops to pet every dog in her path.  A true gem of a human üíé ü•∞ love ya Nellie.ü§™
Don't forget where you came from... In my case right off the set of saved by the bell...HA!  This is my Senior photo!  A few years after this was taken I got into climbing and found my path in life...but at this particular moment in time I was pretty aimless, depressed and desperately wanting to be cool.  High School wasn't the best time for me, (*IT SUCKED) and I split my late teens kind of torn between worlds... sometimes hanging out the with my fellow band geeks and dungeons and dragons dorks and then the next minute trying to be one of the "cool kids," but never quite making the cut.  For kids, or people of any age really.. who are struggling right now.. who feel like they don't fit in...just know that you aren't alone and that life can get better.. amazing even.  Looking back at this kind of sad, earnest kid, I'm super grateful to be able to definitively say that things got WAY better.  I squeezed the juice out of life, traveled the world, climbed on and flew over some outrageous terrain.. fell in love...and generally made life a great one.  And.. I've still got a lot of gas in the tank; motivation for big adventures, and big laughs with the people I love.  This sad bad dressed kid was the seed for a happy man.  So if you are feeling depressed, hopeless or like you don't fit in... that can pass.  But, unfortunately, if you wear an outfit like this and get your senior picture taken... well.... that is forever!
Please click the Link in my Profile!  Do you have a friend who is a master of self sabotage?  I do!  Last year things were finally looking up for my old friend and O.G. Mega-Dirtbag Stonemaster @pitcures_of_fidelman After years of losing money on his "Stone Nudes," calendar and books, which he shot with the tragic diligence of a tortured artist...all on film with... a Medium Format Pentax... Dean had finally gotten a break!  I got together with my old friend @renan_ozturk and together we made an effort to really promote Dean's 20th and last stone nude calendar.  The promotion went a bit viral and next thing you know Dean had sold over 30k in calendars and his instagram following had ballooned from the hundreds to over 13k!  Finally it looked like Dean was going to enjoy some much deserved belated success, and in an unexpected turn, Renan generously gave Dean a Sony A7rii, which would mark the first time that Bullwinkle got to shoot digital.  It was pretty hilarious to watch this old dirtbag enthralled by the magic of being able to instantly see your photos, as he arrived 20 years late to the digital photography party!  It was like watching a caveman see fire for the first time. "what sorcery is this?" And So..it appeared....Dean was enjoying a bit of a renaissance... shooting in color for the first time, and exploring outside of climbing nudes into silk nudes and slackline nudes!  With a ganja smoke induced excitement Dean began posting his uncensored nudes on his insta! I warned him that this was a bad idea, but Dean doubled down with the zealous middle fingers in the air defiance that was characteristic of the stonemaster era of climbing.  It wasn't long before Instagram gave up on pulling down his nudes and just erased his account!  With thirteen thousand less people to sell his work to, and a departure from climbing which was really his main audience Dean had set himself up for a return to his roots as a broke and tortured artist!  Jeeze! This is my last ditch effort to save Dean from himself.  Please support his latest "Photos of Fidelman" project on kickstarter, so that I don't end up with Dean living in my basement and eating my leftovers!  Please!!!

For global climbing day, please enjoy this photo of my favorite climbing partner @nmilfeld on the gnar in Ten Sleep last weekend.  Not only is she a great climbing partner, she‚Äôs a pretty good wife too!

Come on out and I‚Äôll show off my mediocre plastic cranking skills üòú. I‚Äôve heard the pink route is off the chain. #wallsaremeantforclimbing #neverstopexploring

This won‚Äôt work for everyone‚Äôs eye shape or lid type but it helps me! Otherwise I spend way too long attempting to get it looking right and I usually have to do the wing thicker than I like to.

"Meditation, kundalini yoga, and mindfulness have changed my life!! üßòüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I was super iffy on meditation and was always one that could never zone in so I thought, stuff it, it‚Äôs not for me. Until my life started getting extremely overwhelming and my nervous system couldn‚Äôt keep up. I could barely get through my days without feeling extremely WIRED and over stimulated, riddled with anxieties. 
This is when I decided to give it a red hot shot. I began grounding every morning through a 10 minute practice to start my day (meditation, yoga/mindful movements, guided meditations, calming ambience). And also doing kundalini to help strengthen my nervous system daily. I literally can‚Äôt go a day without incorporating at least one of these. It has made me so much more aware of my subtle energies. And now I‚Äôm aware, I can look after myself the way needed instead of burning myself out. 
When I feel myself getting over stimulated I immediately practice one of these tools. 
It has helped me in SO many ways and helps me to do more and be better for not only myself, but everyone around me. 
This is why we created @bloomapp ! So you could have a one stop app for all the tools necessary for your best functioning every single day ‚ù§Ô∏èüôåüèº we are currently having a sale of 50% for first time users for their first month.

When I first came to Margalef in November 2009 I saw @chris_sharma struggling on his hardcore project at Laboratori sector. Dozens of spectators were watching him getting through some savage moves of the lower part to get to the super strenuous upper sequence where he made a desperate throw to a finishing hold. He had to work on the route for 2 seasons to get it done including some 50 falls on that last sequence. The route was named First Round, First Minute and graded solid 9b. 
That year I've been freshly after climbing my first 9a and watching this masterful performance here at Margalef got me super excited. I would never have dreamed to ever get in the same process myself. 
So here I am, after two seasons of falling on that damned slab, the third round on Firs Round starts. Super stoked on what is to come this time... #chrissharma #firstroundfirstminute #margalef #rockclimbing #climbing #9b #climbingpicturesofinstagram #climbingphotography #escaladadeportiva #wspinaniepl"

Even the harshest environments can at times be peaceful, playful and downright pleasant. It‚Äôs these rare slivers of beauty that are so incredibly rewarding to seek out & document. They can feel almost like a gift after being witness to such defeating weather. This moment felt like a distant dream... not a breath of wind, almost surreal. An Aleutian volcano dressed in its spring coating.

"Photographic composition is such an awesome form of expression. Walking up to a subject or landscape & finding your own way of interpreting it. For me, the confluence of these two waterfalls felt impossible to leave out. I loved the way they join together in this glacially fed canyon. Although a frame looking straight down the canyon was incredible & probably visually stronger, it was something I had seen many times before. It was still worth taking & being excited about, but I felt drawn to certain details in the image that give you a little greater sense of place & scale. Love seeing how different lenses interpret these landscpapes

"I‚Äôve been home for just over a day after spending the last 2 weeks in one of my favorite places. Alaska‚Äôs remote Aleutian chain. It also happens to be one of the more remote and challenging places to access. We decided to gamble this time and go late in the season. Most days hovered below freezing with winds gusting up to 50+ knots regularly. I felt prepared for the conditions mentally & physically but it still wrecked my body and my equipment massively. We walked away from the trip with an overwhelming near 30,000 images. 
I‚Äôve found the hardest part of being in this place is leaving... and I don‚Äôt mean because it‚Äôs so beautiful but because the weather get so bad that being stuck there for 2+ weeks with limited food is a common problem. This place is notorious for grounded flights. Half our crew had to wait out the bad weather for 4 extra days and is just finally departing tonight.

#Bill40 is a Honolulu City & County (O ªahu) measure to phase out a wide-range of single-use plastics commonly used in food service (plastic straws, utensils, foam, etc.), over a two year period. While it‚Äôs convenient to have utensils and such when we can‚Äôt access our kitchen at home, the amount of extra garbage created by all of us using single use plastics over the course of a year, decade or lifetime is astounding and not something we can‚Äôt live without. Traveling across this world and to very remote locations, I‚Äôm always blown away at the amount of garbage either in the rivers in Florida, on the beaches of Hawaii, or on an atoll in the middle of the Pacific. At some point soon we need to decide en masse to start undoing this insanely huge mess we have created on earth, and bills like this are small steps in the right direction to help us all change our actions. Please support and call your local representative to voice your thoughts on this being passed in Hawaii. Here‚Äôs to hoping the next generations of kids learn from our mistakes and epiphanies and take the reigns in better directions as the future unfolds. And if you‚Äôre not in Hawaii, think about starting a movement to have this implemented in your hometown and keep @kokuahawaiifoundation, @surfrider, and @sustainablecoastlineshawaii informed on your progress!"

"A Blue-crowned Motmot eats a palm fruit in a secondary forest in central Panama. Motmots eat a wide range of fruits and insects, and are important seed dispersers in this area. Seed dispersal by birds and bats is essential for regeneration of secondary forests on abandoned farmland.

"A bee visits a beautiful Gustavia superba flower in a secondary forest in Panama. Interactions between plants and animals maintain healthy tropical forest ecosystems, where animals are responsible for pollinating more than 95% of tree species, and disperse the seeds of up to 90% of these species. Although Gustavia is common in secondary forests in Panama bees prefer flowers that are high in the canopy and far out of reach, it took me almost a week to get this image waiting for the occasional bees that came down to visit flowers in the understory.

"An aerial view of regenerating secondary tropical forest along the Chagres river near Gamboa, Panama.  This was taken at the end of the dry season and you can see yellow flowering Guayacan trees and leafless Cuipo trees that drop their leaves during the dry season. This is near our house in Panama. We love living here - it‚Äôs a jungle! The majority of the forest around Gamboa is secondary forest less than 100 years old - I recently photographed a story for GEO magazine about secondary forest regrowth in the tropics‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôll be posting more from that work over the next few weeks.

"A Keel-billed Toucan feeds on palm fruits in central Panama. Toucans are one of the few birds that can disperse plants with large seeds and play a key role in dispersal in forests in Central and South America.  They are especially important in young forests growing on abandoned land, as they bring in seeds of many different species that will help the forest regenerate a diverse tree community. Today is #WorldEnvironmentDay

Although they are frugivores for most of the year, during breeding season they often forage for animals to feed to their chicks. I have seen them with insects, small lizards or most commonly chicks stolen from the nests of other birds!

"In the last couple of weeks, I was featured in a bunch of articles and here's a little catching-up on those:

The first one was an Insider (@insider) article, for which there's a link in my bio. A few days after that, I was featured on My Modern Met (@mymodernmet) and in the print version of El Pais Semanal (@elpaissemanal). I'll post some stories with links for those so you can read the articles if you'd like to. And lastly, today I'm being featured in The Guardian! So, if you're in the UK and come across a copy of today's The Guardian, I'd be happy if you could check it out :). A shorter version of the story is also published on The Guardian's website and I'll share a story post with a link to that article as well. And in case you're reading this after the story posts have disappeared from the feed, in my story highlights tab there's a highlight titled ""Publications"" which is dedicated to my press features and you can find links to all these articles there.

I'd like to send my appreciation and gratitude to all those wonderful editors who helped me sharing and spreading my story through these huge media outlets. And I also want to thank you all for the support you provided over the last 5 years. It means a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è. By the way, the first photo in this post is another cut from my ""Neighborhood"" series (which I'm still working on) and it is titled ""Power Dynamics"". Needless to say but the next two images are just different crops from the same image. I hope you enjoy them all.

Happy Sunday y'all! Peace!"

Happy Sunday everyone! In the last 3 months, I visited this place several times and took quite a few pictures and here's the first bunch from those shoots. I had multiple cropping options for the first one and I'm still second-guessing my decision (This happens all the time and honestly,  it needs to stopüòÇ). The 2nd one is probably my favorite. Actually, it is going to be a part of a photo-series titled ""Neighborhood"" (which I'm currently working on). 3rd one is not a kind of photo that I would normally share but I liked it a lot, so there you go üòÅ The 4th and the 5th are very similar to the 1st one.

The word "sade" means "simple" in Turkish (Well, it also means "plain") and as you know simple is how I like my pictures :) My initial idea was to crop out the "e" for a more ironic composition (Obviously there's nothing "sad" with this image) but I decided to go with this one simply because it made much more sense :) Let me know what you think in the comments below.

"People always ask me: Where inspiration came from? I have some advices that could work for you. üí°üí°
1. Think less, create more! I'm always thinking about new concepts but it is more important to actually create something from those ideas I get.

2. See beyond your eyes üëÄ. Inspiration could happen in just one second, so be prepared to catch it and work hard everyday, otherwise you'll waste that precious instant and it may never come back.

3. Listen carefully to people üëÇ. Inspiration could come from any phrase or random thought you hear from people!

4. Travel more and learn about the cultures you visit ‚úàÔ∏è. But, remember that your own culture might as well give you fresh ideas.

5. Search for inspiration üîé. Start looking for creative people around the world and if you have the opportunity, listen very carefully to the things they say they get inspiration from. For instance, I'll be assisting @72kilos and his workshop, this year at @reinvention_la where he will be speaking about searching for the positive side of the ideas. 
And finally: Create every single day, despite your skills!

Global warming has already reached 1¬∞C above the pre-industrial level, due to past and current greenhouse gas emissions. There is overwhelming evidence that this is resulting in profound consequences for ecosystems and people. The ocean is warmer, more acidic and less productive. Melting glaciers and ice sheets are causing sea level rise, and coastal extreme events are becoming more severe. @ipcc Taken on assignment for @smithsonianmagazine in Greenland.
Boat trip in the Ilulissat Icefjord in Greenland. Seeing the glacier so close up was simply breathe taking.  Sermeq Kujalleq or Jakobshavn is one of the fastest (19 m per day) and most active glaciers in the world. It is melting faster than ever before. #Arctic #Greenland #climatechange #glacier #melting #climatechange #climatestrike

Today is World Fertility Day, and I‚Äôm working with my friends at @avawomen to open the discussion and raise awareness about the struggles so many couples face when working to grow their families. Andrew and I learned how trying that experience can be before we were ultimately blessed with our #rainbowbaby, James. All this month, Ava will be shedding light on fertility related topics, and I encourage you to follow along at @avawomen. If you‚Äôre not familiar with Ava, it‚Äôs a bracelet worn while you sleep to monitor your cycle in real time. Timing is everything when you‚Äôre trying to conceive, and Ava really helps take the guesswork out of the equation. Head to avawomen.com and use code CLAIRE for $20 off your bracelet. #AvaPartner #MyFertilityStory #WorldFertilityDay

The opposite of birth control (Part 3)
Here‚Äôs a #fbf for the 7 male followers I have left. Thanks for sticking around!
As I looked on at my adorable little boy this weekend, dressed in his baby blazer and grinning ear to ear, I realized how much my heart and mind have shifted. After he was born, I questioned whether I was cut out to be a mother. I was riddled with anxiety. I had wanted this baby so desperately and yet he brought me to my knees. Every time I put him down to sleep, I was terrified he would suffocate. I lived in fear that I would drop him or fall down the stairs with him in my arms. I worried daily that I would starve him or not give him what he needed to grow. Sometimes I would sit in my car in the driveway and bawl at the thought of going back inside. I felt sick to my stomach as the sun set, knowing that I needed to wake up every few hours and attempt to feed him (another thing I was failing at). On top of all this, I felt immense guilt. I had plenty of support. My wonderful husband, family, and friends were always there to lighten the load. Yet, I felt crippled by an overwhelming sense of failure. I had no idea how to face the next day, week or month. I‚Äôm sharing all of this to say that if you don‚Äôt feel that earth-shattering connection right away, you are not alone. Many of us feel ashamed to open up if we don‚Äôt instantly feel the perfect bonds of motherhood at the moment of birth, but it‚Äôs so important to be honest if you are struggling. I want to thank all the incredible women who were vulnerable and open - like @ellielemons, who inspired me to share this with her own candid post. I look at my son now and am in absolute awe of him. He is my greatest joy. With lots of support and weekly therapy, I was able to address my feelings of anxiety and inadequacy. They resurface every now and then, but I‚Äôm quick to acknowledge them for what they are: fleeting thoughts. I can now honestly say that being James‚Äô mother is the most beautiful thing to ever happen to me.... but I didn‚Äôt feel that way immediately. If you‚Äôre sad, overwhelmed, hopeless or afraid, I promise it gets better. Be open. Ask for help when you need it. And remember that you‚Äôre doing an amazing job. Keep trying ‚ù§Ô∏è

Good luck to you all! 
In the meantime, be inspired by these fantastic interlocking volcanic columns found at the impressive Giants Causeway. These remarkable features are formed as a result of an ancient volcanic fissure eruption 60 million years ago, and is well worth a visit.

"A üåà appears over Sakris√∏y in the Lofoten Islands of Norway after a passing storm. The fjords, mountains and small towns you find above the Arctic Circle up here are often mind-blowing!

What more could a landscape photographer want?"
One of the most sacred rock outcrops in the world, Uluru in the Red Center of Australia is a sight to see! Recently they stopped all tours that set foot on the rock itself because of its sacred meaning and history to the Aboriginal people of Australia. If you haven't been to the @ntaustralia , you need to make sure to add it to your bucket list!
Yup. Norway is pretty amazing in Winter! Not just because of the amazing fjords and seascapes but of course the Northern Lights as well. Can't wait to be back there this February for my annual Lofoten Islands Photo Workshop adventure!

"When it comes to finding dark skies out there around the globe, Mongolia should be at the top of most lists out there. With such large areas of undeveloped land, the number of stars that are visible can be incomprehensible.

For this shot I decided to include a traditional Mongolian Get in the foreground to help not only give the image a sense of places, but also a bit of scale.

"When you travel high above the Arctic Circle in winter, the light is always soft an amazing because of the angle of the sun. This is one of the many reasons I love visiting the Lofoten Islands each Feb. Between the seascapes, fjords and northern lights, it is a landscape photographers dream location!

I recently had 1 spot open up for my Lofoten Workshop Feb 7th - 14th, so be sure to send me a DM if you want more information!"
"A stormy sunrise can often lead to some pretty incredible results, especially in places like Patagonia!

So it seems that IG is doing away with visible like counts. What do you think? Is this a welcomed change or a step in the wrong direction?"
"I love the painterly like like that one can find in places like Patagonia. While the weather can be unpredictable, the light and atmosphere is often amazing because of it!

Does this look like a painting?"
"The early dawn hours along the shores of Lago Pehoe can offer a wide variety of photographic opportunities. While the wind was blowing pretty hard this morning, there were still compositions to be found and water scapes to photograph!

Where is your favorite seascape location to photograph?"

My better half. God has blessed me with the best wife. Anybody who knows us knows that we really are best friends. We haven‚Äôt been married long but it feels like we‚Äôve been married forever. Not the bad kind of forever but the kind you don‚Äôt want to end. Our marriage and relationship is far from perfect and we have so so much to learn. We know that putting God first and each other second works. We know that we might fall out of love one day and will have to choose to either fight for it or not. I also know that 2 years of marriage turns into 20 years of marriage before you even know it. You blink and have 4 kids and wonder where the years went. I hear lots of people down talk young married couples saying we don‚Äôt know much because we lack experience.. and while I agree with this, I also know that if every couple loved each other like they did the first few years of their marriage, most marriages would be a lot happier. It‚Äôs easy to forget why we even fell in love in the first place. I pray I never forget how much I love savannah today, and that God only grows that love as the days turn into years. Ps.. you‚Äôre gonna look smokin at 70 babeüòçüëµüèº

today is world suicide prevention day. the guy you see behind us in the first picture is my friend Jarrid. He was a pastor at a nearby church and was always open about his struggle with depression. He founded an organization dedicated to helping those dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts. He was a good friend to me and hundreds of others. He was an amazing husband to his wife and dad to his two sons. He loved and pointed people to Jesus. Tragically, Jarrid took his own life last night. I‚Äôm at a loss of words and my heart is broken. He has a wife and two young sons.. I wish I did more. Don‚Äôt forget to tell people you love them. You never know what someone might be battling. You are so loved more than you know. If you or someone you know is struggling, please reach out. I‚Äôll tag Jarrid and his wife‚Äôs page for you to learn more. ‚ÄúNothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus‚Äù (Romans 8:39) I‚Äôll miss you, Jarrid.

"Brown Sugar Bourbon Cookie Butter Bars. Still absolutely drooling over these. @HeritageDistillery  @brownsugarbourbon is one of my FAV additions to baked goods. The bourbon brings on a very similar flavor to browned butter, but better! .

.
1 Stick of unsalted, browned butter
1 Cup of cookie butter, divided
3/4 Cup of brown sugar
3/4 Cup of white granulated sugar
2 Large eggs
1 Tablespoons of vanilla extract
2 Tablespoons of brown sugar bourbon 
2 1/2 Cups of all purpose flour
1 1/2 Teaspoon of salt
1/2 Teaspoon of baking powder
1 Teaspoon of cornstarch
.
.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line with parchment paper and grease a 9X9 inch pan.
In a medium bowl whisk together flour, salt, baking powder and cornstarch, set aside.
In another medium bowl whisk together browned butter, ¬Ω cup of cookie butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Add in egg yolks and bourbon, vanilla extract, whisk once more until smooth.

"We wouldn‚Äôt be here if not for our parents. They gave us life, nurtured us, raised us and eventually set us free to discover ourselves. üëµüëµüëµ On this day I am especially grateful for my late mother Helga Anna-Johanna Anker. She passed away this past June, quietly at home while enjoying her needle point.  No pain, no burden; an ideal transition. üåù

Born near Dresden, East Germany in 1933 she met my father Wallace Robert in 1955 in Berlin. As a phlebotomist she and her friends went to a social venue that allowed the tables to telephone each other, an old school dating app. Wally rang Helga and loved ensued. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Having been born into the atrocity of the Third Reich and witnessed the destruction of war, she knew what hardship was. Moving to San Francisco with a young man was her chance at a new life. As an immigrant she reminded us to work hard. As a child of an immigrant I witnessed prejudice towards a woman with an accent. Both of these experiences shaped who I am and my world view. 
In her 86 years she saw joy and happiness through her family. My older sisters Kim and Denise taught me to be kind. My brother Steve was my partner in adventure and minor league sibling pranks. Together the six of us were a happy family. 
The carbon that constituted my parents is now being recycled. Their souls and energy is carried forward by their children and their legacy. Thanks Mom and Dad for believing in me. I‚Äôll always be there for family because of what you instilled in us.

"January 1993 : Photograph by Jay Smith 
Although this looks like winter, the image was taken during the austral summer of 1992/ 93. Jay ‚ÄúNo Spray‚Äù Smith, Steve Gerberding and  I had spent a miserable night in bivouac sacs as a humid storm rolled in and quashed our summit bid. We had spent the season trying a direct line on the east Face of Torre Egger in Patagonia. On our summit bid we were shut down by the proverbial ‚Äústeel glove‚Äù of wind and snow. 
We didn‚Äôt have internet based weather forecasts. Or the internet for that matter. Our summit attempt was based on what the Thommen barometer / altimeter was telling us, if the bits of ice in Laguna Torre were blown northward, if we saw a condor circling and if the camp fox walked through the little sand patch next to our tent. The latter two indicators were superstitious. Perhaps the placebo effect instills confidence? Whatever it takes. 
Jay is a survivor. His climbs, all bad to the bone, span the globe. The lessons he shared with me, passed on from the late Jim Bridwell, helped define how I would interpret the mountains. Be calm under pressure, dial one pitch at a time and it could always be worse. Thanks Jay for the years of friendship.

"@kaijonesski and his uncle @jeremyjones breaking camp at the 2019 @protectourwinters summit in Moab, Utah. 
In 2007 Jeremy Jones realized the effect that anthropogenic climate change was having on winters. Specifically, the snow that blankets the northern hemisphere where Jeremy plies his craft as a big mountain snowboarder. Rather than shrug his shoulders and drop in for another run, Jermey turned his motivation and creativity into a voice for winter. 
Thanks to data and science we understand how a changing climate is affecting human existence. The foundation of life - water, food and shelter will be affected by our existence. A hotter planet will disproportionately affect marginalized communities. The burden will be borne by future generations. 
Climate activism asks of its adherents to care about the future of our planet and species. Our generation, the first to be cognizant of climate change, has the opportunity to act and address critical change to ensure that the planet can support humanity for generations to come.

Humans are not perfect. Those of us who live in modernized cultures have evolved to consume tons of carbon. Our lifestyles leave a big footprint. Each of us can work towards a less energy intensive existence, which will help the CO2 conundrum. More significantly, we need to encourage governments to be proactive in addressing this challenge by reducing carbon centric energy and embracing sustainability. 
Live your life through the prism of future generations. How will our actions today affect their existence?"

"I don't usually frequent ""tourist"" attractions when I'm on assignment, but on a recent trip to Kathmandu with a friend, I brought her to experience all the standard touristy things, from lunch in Thamel to the smashans (creation pyres) of Pashupatinath. 
Pictured here are sadhus photographed on assignment for National Geographic at Pashupatinath in Kathmandu.. almost 10 years ago.  A lot has changed since then from the earthquake to continued westernization. 
I think we all battle with change. It's not easy. And the nostalgic feelings we get from remembering our past can get in the way of the promises of tomorrow. Our past can be used as a reminder - a teacher - on what to do or not do. But we are wired to evolve...and it is up to us to choose to transform towards the best version of ourselves.

"On my way back after a long journey again in Nepal only for a short break before I head to Pakistan. Looking forward to being home for more than a few days..don't think I've been home for a consecutive week or two since returning from Everest. 
Looking forward to days like this in Rocky Mountain National Park..if I'm home long enough!

"Today is World Children's Day and November 20th has seen two important children's rights declarations. In 1959 the UN adopted the ""Declaration of the Rights of the Child"" and in 1989 UN General Assembly adopted the ""Convention on the Rights of the Child.""
.
We all play a role in making today relevant. Today offers us the opportunity to advocate, promote and celebrate children's rights. It is also the opportunity to create dialogue and transform words into actions.
.
So let's start the dialogue: How will you promote children's rights today? Any action, big or small, is important.

"As the new week presents itself, and we get back to the ""daily grind"", we are given an opportunity to start anew. Every morning for me is full of choices: Will I get to the gym early? Will I eat healthy? Will I make the time for those that I love even when it appears that schedules are packed? Will I execute that new pitch? It's easy to keeping doing what I've always done, but more rewarding to do what I've dreamt and never pursued. 
The act of letting go and moving is mimicked in the sunrise/sunset of every day... Pictured here: Sunrise in the Cordillera Blanca mountains of Peru.

"Vegan Avocado Aioli with crispy smashed potatoes. I use olive oil daily in my kitchen & this extra virgin olive oil from Spain (@oliveoilworldtoureu , @oliveoilsspain ) works great in this vegan aioli. I paired it with potatoes but you can also use it as a dip for any veggie of your choice. 
Ingredients:
2 avocados
Juice of ¬Ω a lime
Pinch of garlic powder
¬º cup of natural soy yogurt 
¬º cup of olive oil
1 tablespoon of parsley
1 teaspoon of smoked paprika
Sea salt to taste
Chili powder to taste

Blend all of the ingredients until smooth. 
Serve it with your favorite roasted vegetable.

Eggs & avo are always a good idea! Poached eggs, bacon, avocado, parmesan, caramelized red onions, hollandaise sauce with fresh herbs & arugula at @factorygirlcafe
Always happy when the sun is out. My skincare favorites are now on my blog. Link in my bio @cravingsinamsterdam
"Made my coconut shrimp with pineapple salsa but instead of serving it in a taco, made a bowl with rice. Either way you want to serve it, it makes a delicious meal. Direct link for the recipe in my bio @cravingsinamsterdam. 
Got the frozen shrimp through the online supermarket @crisp_nl. I‚Äôve been using it for a few months now & the quality of the products are very good. Plus you always get a gift with your order."
Can you spot the kitty? @lidlnederland now has veggie wraps made with beet & carrot. Perfect to bring extra color & veggies to your dishes. I served them in a snack platter that is easy to make for any gathering. With mango hummus, beet hummus & Tzatziki. I also love the tortillas with a piece of cheddar & apple. These wraps will be at the Lidl for a limited time only. #Ad #Lidlnederland #Delicieux #bietenwrap #wortelwrap
Hello fall! So happy to see blue skies after all the rain we‚Äôve been getting.
I love brunch & I also love Korean food, so I combined the two with this Korean fried cauliflower and waffles. Spicy & sticky. With crunchy cucumber and paired with a Bloody Mary made with @ketelone Vodka. This Sunday Ketel One is celebrating National Brunch day with 35 restaurants participating all over NL. You can check their Facebook page for more information. #familyyoumake #ketelonevodka #nationalbrunchday #ad
Made a Banh Mi with crispy tofu (breaded with Panko), pickled daikon & carrot, wasabi lime mayo, coriander & cucumber. Served it in a sourdough baguette from one of my favorite bakeries.
The perks of traveling during monsoon season, we basically had a private beach! We were super lucky & only got rain once for 30 minutes during our stay. Check my stories for some more drone footage.
Loved the ramen & the atmosphere of this place. Made us feel like we were back in Japan for a bit. I‚Äôve added it to my Amsterdam food guide. Link in my bio.

"Below is a repost from @jacquifink about the current bushfire crisis in Australia.  Jacqui has phrased it so clearly and eloquently that I don‚Äôt think I need to add to it other than to say, if you are a knitter or crocheter, please help if you can. Repost from @jacquifink using @RepostRegramApp - Knitters of the World - Australia needs your help. Over 1 million hectares of land have been burning in 300 fires across NSW and Queensland. Much of this is critical Koala Habitat - a species that is now considered ‚Äúfunctionally extinct‚Äù. Populations have been decimated and those who have survived are badly injured. It‚Äôs important to acknowledge that so many other animals have perished in these devastating fires. So too have people and hundreds of homes leaving families with nothing. Our hearts are heavy and so many of us are in a state of bewilderment and anger at the lack of political will to address the broader issues at play here. But that‚Äôs a conversation for another time and platform. Right now, we need to do what we can to make a difference where we can. There has been a call out for knitted, crocheted or sewn Koala mittens and Joey pouches for our beloved kangaroos, and other natives such as possums and wombats, to help in the treatment of burns. Email me for the patterns at hello@littledandelion.com. I have a fantastic PDF I can send you. No DMs please.  I am happy to be the point of collection and you‚Äôll find my postal address in my Bio information. Please show our global leaders what can be achieved when we act as a collective consciousness and show compassion and love for those in need. We are all one. We are all connected. Let‚Äôs be the light for those who have forgotten to see. Please share this post or tag the crafter in your life so that they can help spread the word. Our beautiful precious Aussie wildlife needs your love and care. Many thanks and much love, Jac

From the most southern part of the Netherlands last week, to Terschelling, the most northern part of the Netherlands.
The American cemetery in Margraten @inlimburg. What an impressive monument to commemorate the American fallen soldiers that helped liberate us. There are 8.301 graves and crosses on 65 acres, just to give you an idea of the scale of this monument.
The South of the Netherlands is just magical, especially in Fall... @inlimburg #inlimburg

"MY LAST BREATH‚†Ä
‚Äú....I‚Äôve had many out of body experiences in my life but never quite as real as when I fell off a 10 foot tall moving stage onto my head. You can imagine it wasn‚Äôt pretty in the middle of a live performance. I passed out mid fall, my body making its exit mid trauma so I didn‚Äôt feel the end impact when I hit the floor and had a seizure. It all played out in slow motion. After my body retreated, all I remember was a weightlessness like I‚Äôve never felt before. Completely without body, floating towards a bright light. Heavenly!!!...‚Äù - @cuchira‚†Ä

"It‚Äôs easy to see when someone is IN THEIR ELEMENT, doing EXACTLY what they were brought to üåç to do and LIVING IN THEIR PASSION! They GLOW! Their focus is wholly absorbed. Every bit of their BEING is PRESENT! ‚†Ä ‚†Ä
This is what I KNOW when I watch @offcina.movimento share his knowledge on the BODY & how to MOVE SMART. I always shed a little tear when I watch him teach cause it so DAMN REAL & I shed a BIG tear when he teaches me (cause damn I work up a sweat). Whichever variation of the tear I‚Äôm shedding, I can tell you that there‚Äôs nothing like being taught by someone who is PASSIONATELY COMMITTED & INVESTED to their craft. There‚Äôs nothing better than LIVING IN ONES PURPOSE. @offcina.movimento & I definitely see üëÅ to üëÅ in this. WE ARE COMMITTED TO LIVING OUR PASSION & SHARING IT.‚†Ä ‚†Ä
Now, I will tell you that often times living your passion doesn‚Äôt make ‚Äúliving‚Äù in this society very easy. I find people are often looking for cheap price vs quality, which takes them towards investing in big chain companies vs independent craftsman‚Äôs/artists. But they are overlooking one very important thing‚Ä¶ PASSION = QUALITY! Why? Because being an independent artist is HARD AF! We do it because we BELIEVE in what we do! We want our product to be pure, no one watering down the content to make it ‚Äúwidely accessible‚Äù so that everybody can üí∞ for cheap. Trust me, I‚Äôve turned down some really big sponsorship offers from BIG companies for this exact reason! ‚†Ä ‚†Ä
Hiring a trainer/coach/specialist who is passionate about what they do is an AMAZING INVESTMENT! NOT ALL TEACHERS ARE CREATED EQUAL. Sorry not sorry, had to say it. There are those that care & those that call it a job. When selecting who is going to work with your body, your home, your vessel, DO YOUR HOMEWORK! Trust me! It will cost you a whole lot more in the end rehabilitating from injuries from bad training habits than investing in the right person to do the best FOR YOU! ‚†Ä ‚†Ä
Lastly, because I know how people think.... ‚†Ä
‚≠êÔ∏èCaption is long... continues in comments ‚ò∫Ô∏è ALSO HUUUUGE IG STORY about today‚Äôs topic! GO CHECK IT!"
"I‚Äôm no nutritionist but people often ask me what I eat. It has been a process getting myself to eat the way I do today.

I spent most of my childhood starving myself (for reasons revealed in TODAY‚ÄôS BLOG on the BUFFET OF GOODNESS TIER on PATREON.COM/MOVMEANT). This took its toll overtime, ulcers at 14 yrs old being one of the many consequences. Body dysmorphia, that had to be addressed as well. In time I‚Äôve been able to get my body/mind back to health with proper foods and CONSISTENT/ SMART moving/exercising. *Not all foods and movement are created equal, DO YOUR HOMEWORK!

Today‚Äôs blog on my patreon account is super important! There‚Äôs so many diets (none of which I personally define myself by). The eating game can be confusing. What‚Äôs ‚Äúin‚Äù today, is ‚Äúout‚Äù tomorrow. Foods and fads. What works for one, doesn‚Äôt work for another. I have a system that not only works for everyBODY but penetrates healthy BEING into your entire life. It‚Äôs bigger than just food! 
Go check out today‚Äôs blog and so much more on patreon.com, THE BUFFET OF GOODNESS tier. 
One love, 
Cuchira"
"TRUE LOVE‚†Ä
‚†Ä
This is what true love looks like: Wiping the hair off your face but then accidentally poking you in the eye. Grooming one another like monkeys to express a love that only popping each other‚Äôs zits can convey. Using your spit to heal their wounds. Apologizing and giggling like mad when a fart (or two) slips out. Shouting, ‚Äúah dayum amor!‚Äù when you flip up the sheets during the night and the fart smell makes a lingering exit. Having intense conversations on the üöΩ as you speak around the ‚Äúplops‚Äù and still thinking they‚Äôre the hottest thing in the world. Picking each other‚Äôs boogers because you can‚Äôt have your ‚Äúother‚Äù go out into the world with that thing hanging out their nose. Massaging out a muscle spasm, accidentally slipping and pressing ever NOT-so gently on his balls. Waking up with a tore up shoulder because you just wanted to hug each other all night but you don‚Äôt own one of those fancy cuddle mattresses. Getting off cracking each other‚Äôs backs in one squeeze. Casually cleaning the house butt naked while you listen to your favorite podcast. Slapping each other‚Äôs ass every time they bend over and thinking it‚Äôs hilariously sexy. Sticking your finger in their mouth every time they yawn. Waking up with stank breath but that can‚Äôt stop you from passionately kissing each other first thing in the morning. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
And after all that saying, ‚ÄúI love you infinitely‚Äù and meaning it about a hundred times a day. THAT‚ÄôS true love.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Te amo @offcina.movimento ‚†Ä

The Oratory of Santa Margherita‚Äîfrom my stay at @grandhotelvillatorretta @CurioCollection in Milan. This glorious chapel on the hotel property is adorned with 15th-century frescoes, soft light, and the most beautiful ceiling details. For a perfect 24 hours in Milan see the link in my bio. Check out Stories too, to see some of my favorite places in one of my favorite cities. #citiesbycurio
I‚Äôve done my fair share of sitting @themarlboroughlodge but Marlborough is a treasure trove of food, wine and scenery waiting to be explored. Taste your way through the famous Marlborough wine region, explore the tranquil waterways of the Marlborough Sounds, or take advantage of the many onsite activities in this oasis of calm. I‚Äôm sad to go but had one of the best experiences ever here. Thanks for the wonderful stay. New Zealand, you‚Äôve been lovely.
I seldom give myself permission to relax and unwind but the idyllic setting @themarlboroughlodge is designed to make you stop and reflect. Surrounded by beautiful flower and vegetable gardens, orchards, and vineyards, the grounds of the lodge are the perfect place for a relaxing stroll between naps.
The Library‚Äîmy favorite room @themarlboroughlodge and perfect for cozying up in a cushy armchair with a good book and a glass of Pinot Noir.
I will be right here. @themarlboroughlodge

"A travel drawing, because I should do them more besides taking pictures!üå¥üá∫üá∏I‚Äôm so thankful my job takes me to so many beautiful places.
As you might have seen on my stories, I‚Äôm here in California for a bit! I was in LA last week for Adobe MAX and now I‚Äôm chilling in Burbank until @ctnexpo in less than two weeks already ‚ú® TIME FLIES! I‚Äôm very excited to be there and see some of you guys hopefully ‚ô•Ô∏è I‚Äôve met a ton of amazingly talented people so far, mostly new people, which was challenging, but good. You know who you are, I enjoyed our conversations! ‚òÄÔ∏è Besides that, I was wondering if you guys have absolute must see/do/eat/drink recommendations for me in the area? Let me know please ‚ô•Ô∏è"
I did some art for some merch so here‚Äôs the original illustration of @AmazingPhil for the ‚Äúglitch‚Äù hoodie he just launched uwu he was a joy to draw and so was this style to work in üí´‚ú® slightly different than the usual so I hope you guys don‚Äôt mind hehe
The first one in particular has beent he victim of a lot of art theft but also been featured on a lot of reposting pages, in a ‚Äú1,2,3,4 or 5? üòç tag ur friend!‚Äù Kinda way so I figured it might be a decent idea to protect my work and say hellooo im the artist haha. They‚Äôre also here because they‚Äôre one of the reasons my instagram took off in the first place and that‚Äôs the reason why I‚Äôm currently at #AdobeMAX as an #AdobePartner with the Insiders group. It‚Äôs such an honor!! I can‚Äôt wait to take a sunny picture in the gorgeous LA weather to do a new ootd~ though first i gotta get over my jet lag haha. I‚Äôll be posting updates about the event on my stories! üíï‚ú®

"wanted to do some digital colors on this but my file got corrupted so i ended up with this

"Pairing your classic vans with a pair of wide pants instead of skinny jeans can make you go from ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs today‚Äôs class about?‚Äù To ‚Äúmy class today‚Äôs about‚Äù in two secs

Except i was going to my friends to game.. and my bag is just filled with drinks and snacks üëÄ‚ú®"
"Though I‚Äôm anxious about doing it sometimes, not feeling like it‚Äôs my place to do.. some of my proudest work is using my art and platform to aid activists and create positive noise and increase their message. I, and everyone individually, may be small and insignificant, but people like @claire.wineland and greta thunberg are a huge reminder that our voices are important, if they can, so can we. They grew beyond themselves and became so much bigger than we could ever imagine ourselves to be, and even a year after passing away, Claire lives on in her work. 
I‚Äôm really happy to see the amazing support on the drawing I posted last night and wanted to elaborate on why I chose to make something. Art is an amazing tool to share a message, and I‚Äôm excited to see promising youth‚Äôs word taken seriously and discussed on such a grand scale."

"What I think in red versus what everyone else seems to think about how a quality cut of beef should be prepared ü•©ü§∑üèª To me, it's personal preference. That's why you're given a choice on how you want your beef cooked when ordering. I personally like a good steak to be on the rare side because I think you get more flavor and best texture out of it. But there's plenty of people who don't think the same, which is obvious from my previous post. So, I'd like to know what more people really think is best and for what reason. And why is rare beef such a turn off to so many meateaters? Please be respectful of everyone's opinion. Don't start any beef ü§£ This is a good topic of discussion I'd like to hear more thoughts on.

Smelling Omnia Crystalline by @bulgariparfums instantly takes me back to my first trip to Rome.

That trip is so special to me because I was learning so much about myself during that time in my life, and travel really is the best teacher.

O Renan postou aqui no instagram um v√≠deo dizendo que ia operar na @aacd hoje de manh√£ e queria me conhecer (veja o v√≠deo arrastando pro lado). A noite chegou e infelizmente ele teve a sua vontade atendida: fui encher o saco dele. O Renan ama o The Noite - e eu o aconselhei a nunca mais assistir aquela porcaria. Mas a minha surpresa mesmo e √© que ele se declarou f√£ do filme dos ‚ÄúExterminadores do Al√©m contra a Loira do Banheiro‚Äù. Ele conhecia todas as cenas de cor e pirou quando eu mostrei pra ele no meu celular as fotos exclusivas da s√©rie que vai estrear ano que vem ! Foi um prazer e uma alegria te conhecer, Renan! Fico feliz que tudo deu certo na cirurgia e que logo logo voc√™ estar√° em casa! Em breve, conforme te prometi, postarei aqui o v√≠deo do nosso encontro! Deus aben√ßoe voc√™ e sua fam√≠lia!

√öltima di√°ria de grava√ß√£o da s√©rie @osexterminadoresdoalem . Desde Setembro est√° sendo guerrilha pura para todo mundo, s√≥ quem esteve no set sabe. Foi um desafio grande para todos. Mas o resultado final est√° ficando sensacional. Em breve, com calma, farei um v√≠deo agradecendo melhor todos os envolvidos, mas por enquanto deixo aqui um muito obrigado para toda equipe, dire√ß√£o, fotografia, produ√ß√£o, √°udio, maquiagem, figurino, dubl√™s, efeitos, arte e elenco. Eu tenho certeza que voc√™s nunca viram uma s√©rie nacional como essa que estamos fazendo e sem a garra e empenho de todas essas pessoas nada disso seria poss√≠vel. E agora vou pro set, porque seguimos at√© as 6 da manh√£ nessa pegada - e depois as 11 vou pro SBT fazer The Noite. A zuera nunca dorme!

"Earlier this month, I was commissioned to capture images of Jack Daniel‚Äôs Sinatra Select, shot on film. The brand has been part of my history, in a way, as my dad was a Jack Daniel's fan ‚Äî my parents even had an old JD barrel in the front porch of the house where I grew up. In the years since my dad‚Äôs passing, having a glass of this lovely 90-proof (45%) whiskey ‚Äî neat ‚Äî reminds me of when my dad and I would share a drink and catch up about my travels, music, life, and love.
‚†Ä
This Sinatra Select edition is my favorite to date, not least because I‚Äôve spent so many years of my life as a fan of Frank‚Äôs songs, performing many of them on stages around the U.S. This is a whiskey meant to be savored, just as anything that encourages us to slow down and enjoy the moment.

Sometimes you need to be unlucky to get lucky! We missed the train stop when we were heading to Arashiyama Bamboo Forest. We ended up in this beautiful train station on a bridge between the mountains. So if you‚Äôre heading to Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, then make a little visit to this spot! We had to run to the other side quickly to catch the train, but I was lucky to quickly snap this photo!
Mountain views in Kyoto!
Blown away by the details of the Osaka castle. Nice to look from the distance and close by!

Magical morning moments in the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. Luckily we didn‚Äôt let the rainy start for the day stop us from heading out! The weather turned out really nice after the sunrise and we were able to enjoy this famous little path near Kyoto.

Almost ten years has passed since my last visit to the land of the rising sun. I don‚Äôt know why it took me so long to come back!

My favorite way to start the trip is with an amazing cup of coffee from a local coffee shop!

One of my favorite mornings to witness the sunrise and autumn foliage this year! Dolomites area was pretty magical!
Oh yes I did! I was driving by this famous place on my way back to Germany and of course I needed to check this place out again, after many years. It‚Äôs still beautiful!
Have a nice weekend you all! So funny to see that all of these places are covered in snow just as I left! Good timing for my trip to chase these colors!

I grew up living in a beach town. Fell in love with photography in that town. Now I live very near my childhood beach home and it smells just like it here in the outer banks. Pine scents mixed with salt in the air. This is fragile territory. A sand bar. Classified officially as barrier islands moving around every 5 seconds for the last few million years. Add global warming to the natural ebb and flow and things are gonna change. So the outer banks and eastern seaboard in general will be where I will plant my tripod. Come hell or high water. A healthy percentage of  profits from my workshops and print/book sales will go to environmental charity. Seems like a no brainer. See link in bio.#fujix100f #rio #parkour"

Artist Reba Peck at home in Sugar Hollow. Reba defies any interpretation of style for her artwork that I‚Äôm qualified to make yet her period of coloring over her family snapshots is forever compelling. Reba is the most self effacing artist I‚Äôve ever met. Her life partner and father of their sons Ian and Eli is photographer/producer Michael ‚ÄúNick‚Äù Nichols. So Reba has been surrounded by a whole bunch of photo egos all along. Say that to her and she‚Äôd just chuckle. For Reba knows who she is.. Always has.  She‚Äôs somehow solid and soft simultaneous. Not conflictive yet standing tall. Check out Reba‚Äôs hand colored portraits. You may feel her Alabama roots and maybe you feel there is mystery here that‚Äôs gonna stay mystery ..good.. Dissecting the origins of personal art is guesswork.  The work reveals all that needs be...üéà#rebapeck @michaelnicknichols
Ritual. My brother Gary was one of my earliest photo subjects. He, my sister Patricia, mom and dad , plus assorted pets were my only subjects when I started shooting seriously at 13. I dreamed of being a pro and world travel yet around the house and our street were my real world. So my first hand made book in 1958 ‚ÄúOff For A Family Drive‚Äù is the basis for my next super eclectic book with same title new surprises coming spring 2020. I shot this picture yesterday visiting the New England branch of the Harvey clan. I want the last pictures in the book to be shot right up to press time .  A work in progress a kaleidoscope rather than a retrospective. I hate the thought of a retro. Somebody else can make that for me after I‚Äôm gone. In the meantime I keep shooting. For fun as always. It‚Äôs never been a ‚Äújob‚Äù for me. I knew at 13 I‚Äôd never have a job. Lots is happening with the family wing here in Massachusettes and I‚Äôm shooting it all as I did with the Colorado side of the family just last month. I‚Äôm blessed with a solid family. The other stuff seems irrelevant. Otter will swim through the frigid Atlantic to get that stick and bring it back tail wagging wet cold. Ritual the purest kind. Family.

"@erinharveypics #repost ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢@magnumphotos 
Both of these photographs just left our solar system on the spacecraft Voyager 2 and were taken by my dad, @davidalanharvey.  His long career continues to soar to new heights, and he has plenty of other shots that he prefers on an artistic level.  But I‚Äôve always thought that having two of his photographs chosen back in 1977 by a team led by Carl Sagan and NASA to represent the planet Earth to extraterrestrials in outer space (!!!) was particularly cool.  The first picture, a father holding his child, was taken as our whole family was on assignment with my dad in Malaysia (the first few weeks of kindergarten would have to wait). And the second picture, geese flying at sunset, was taken in Virginia, near where I live now.  These are two photographs of just over a hundred that were sent on Voyager 1, which already left our solar system in 2012, and Voyager 2, which has now broken free as well - interstellar messages in a bottle.  Both space probes carry my dad‚Äôs images on two specially made golden records along with sounds like crickets and a kiss, Mozart and Chuck Berry.  Hurtling through space for the past 42 years at 36,000 mph, they are now 16.58 light hours from the sun.  It was a Voyager probe that was at the center of the plot for the original ‚ÄúStar Trek: The Motion Picture‚Äù, and it was a Voyager probe that brought the alien Jeff Bridges (the Dude!) to Earth in ‚ÄúStarman‚Äù. Who knows whether the spacecraft and the photos will ever really be found by intelligent life out there, but it‚Äôs fun to dream.  And still as cool to me as it ever was."
We know all walls fall. 30 years ago I was commissioned at the last minute by @natgeo to cover THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL. Most of the press had already been there for days. I literally pulled up in a taxi from the airport and paid the driver to watch my gear (for 2 days) as I somehow covered the final moments of the wall. I finally got a hotel then stayed for days to shoot the flow of East Germans and West Berliners back and forth. See my link in profile.#berlinwall @magnumphotos

Girls and boys are speaking up, demanding their rights and leading the way. I am so proud to have been able to stand with them today at the @unitednations and I hope you‚Äôll join me. #WorldChildrensDay @unicef
Today, I am honoured to be in New York with @unicef to mark World Children‚Äôs Day. I had the privilege of joining some brilliant young activists at the @unitednations to lend my voice to those calling for change. When we empower and protect children we give them the opportunity to unlock their incredible potential. We must listen to them and we must act for them. #WorldChildrensDay
Surprisingly getting my ears pierced wasn‚Äôt the dumbest decision made this week

In honor of all the merch being up to 40% off. I‚Äôm cutting natalie‚Äôs salary by 40%. Plz don‚Äôt tell her
After a long few months, I officially signed the divorce papers to my wife, Lorraine. Jason your mother was a real treat. With that being said I also reactivated my @bumble account and I‚Äôm ready to start swiping. See you soon ladies

I was dressed as a cop last night and I stumbled upon this crime scene and it was probably the best moment of my week
Icebergs are one of my favorite things to photograph. This is actually a small iceberg called a bergybit and a temporary resting place for chinstrap and gentoo penguins near Danko Island, Antarctic Peninsula. Icebergs are a good metaphor for the sea: only a very small percentage visible to our  human eye. // #iceberg #penguin #moreocean #joy #antarctica // join us in #ParkCity #Utah Dec 14 for Coral Kingdoms and Empires of Ice at the Eccles Center Theater with #NatGeoLive
"Honored that the image ‚ÄúGarden Of Eels‚Äù
 from Dauin Philippines was awarded winner of the underwater category for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Awards. The image was made on @natgeo assignment using remote cameras to capture these ultra shy creatures that vanish into the sand the moment they detect company. The best way to make an image of these magical creatures is to literally vanish as well. Every picture  is a team collaboration: photographer, guide, boat captain, surface support  and sponsors. Thank you to a great Philippine Team. Through collaboration we achieve. / #WPOTY2019 #Philippines #Ocean #KeepShooting #CollaborationAmplifiesConservation #Gratitude  for #MoreOcean follow @daviddoubilet"
Opal Reef on the Great Barrier Reef. The late largest most iconic coral reef system may be located in Queensland Australia but it really belongs to the world. When I was a kid the Great Barrier was the first reef on my radar of imagination. The worlds largest reef experienced sequential coral bleaching events in 2016 & 2017 affecting more than half of 1400 mile long structure. Thermal stress causes the coral polyp to lose its symbiotic algae that provide color and supplemental nutrients. Unprecedented back to back bleaching have left this great reef with little time to recover and struggling to survive. These images were photographed on assignment with @natgeo // #ocean #coralreef #greatbarrierreef #climatechange #climatesummit2019 #followme for #moreocean follow @daviddoubilet
Waves and wind sculpt a grounded iceberg in Blanley Bay in the Canadian Arctic. Icebergs are a good metaphor for the sea: a large percentage of an iceberg  is normally hidden from our human eye. We discovered a bay filled with grounded icebergs that resembled an Arctic art gallery. Sadly this beauty is too often generated by the rapid retreat of melting glaciers in a warming Arctic. When I can I try to make these types of half and half images because they make a connection between the surface and the secret world below. // with @natgeoexpeditions @natgeo @lindbladexp // #oceans #arctic #icebergs #climatechange #climatesummit #polar #ThisIsEarth #ExploreMore for #MoreOcean follow @daviddoubilet

There is something absolutely magical about Israel.¬†¬†I‚Äôve never felt such a sense of spirituality or connection to God‚Ä¶something I‚Äôve been missing for a few years now.¬†¬†Spirituality is so important to me‚Ä¶to be baptized in the Jordan river ‚Äì the same place Jesus was baptized ‚Äì I‚Äôve never felt more renewed in my life.

Honestly L‚ÄôOreal is consistently challenging standard approaches to beauty, and by celebrating and supporting the incredible work these founders do, they‚Äôre shining a very powerful light on the true meaning of beauty, in all the forms it can take. 
I feel lucky to be in the league and wildly inspired by so many of the queens of this community‚Äî we don‚Äôt deserve you. But I want to.

Hoje √© o dia dela que eu tenho uma enorme gratid√£o em conviver diariamente. Uma pessoa linda em todos os sentidos, sempre preocupada em entregar o melhor. O melhor para sua fam√≠lia, o melhor para o seu filho, o melhor para seus amigos, o melhor para nossa equipe e o melhor tamb√©m para nossos clientes. Com ela aprendi a desacelerar, aprendi a ter calma e paci√™ncia para esperar o melhor resultado, aprendi a ser sempre persistente em busca da f√≥rmula ideal. Ela que √© puro talento e criatividade me ensina diariamente tamb√©m a ser uma pessoa melhor, no in√≠cio ach√°vamos que √©ramos iguais porque a nossa sintonia √© sempre enorme, nos vestimos iguais sem saber, acordamos de madrugada com a mesmas preocupa√ß√µes (o bom √© que dar pra fazer reuni√£o on line nessas horas), mas recentemente  enxergamos que na verdade o que temos em comum s√£o o valores e as nossas habilidades e perfis s√£o completamente  diferentes, por√©m, complementares. Isso me fez entender porque a nossa sociedade deu t√£o certo e quem era s√≥cia virou para mim uma amiga para VIDA! Voc√™ merece tudo de melhor! Parab√©ns!!!!

Searching for a species of fish that has long thought to be extinct, today the U.S. Kazakh & Russian ichthyologists will fish the Keles River on the edge of the Kazakhstan village of Kyzylasker along the Uzbekistan border.

The Navajo Generating Station, the largest coal plant in the western USA, stands on the edge of Page, Arizona in October 2019. The plant, which emits tens of millions of tons of carbon dioxide each year, has been now been shut down by its private owners. It‚Äôs a big win for the planet. It‚Äôs also a major immediate challenge to the Native American communities that have relied on the jobs the plant has created, pointing to the need to support those impacted in the transition away from fossil fuels. Communities like Page, which were feeding the hunger for cheap electricity in far away Phoenix or LA, often lacked electricity for their own residents and suffered from some of the worst air quality in the country.

"My main man in Nepal has started a new trekking company @VajraAdventure. I‚Äôve used his previous company twice; first for three passes with Island Peak summit, and most recently an expedition to the savagely gorgeous AMA DABLAM!

"Everything is an experience. It could be simple things like living by yourself, owning property, participating college, raising a child or tour-cycling.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve become a student, which is something I haven‚Äôt experienced. 
I feel wisdom doesn‚Äôt come by age ‚Äî it comes with experiences.

For me, looking back at previous chapters in my life is fulfilling; like this image. My absolute favourite camp of the 3200km cycle-tour of Norway in the northernmost province; the sheer vastness, stunning sunset and intriguing Sami culture made this camp memorable."

"Despite having completed my final round of chemotherapy the adventure still isn‚Äôt over. Right before this very picture was taken I ate some spoiled pork meat and contracted a tropical parasite. This pesky little worm found its way to my brain and started eating at my visual cortex. It occasionally triggers vivid colour visuals and could lead to epileptic-seizures. ‚Å£
‚Å£
I must admit, that parasite is a fighter, how did it survive over a year with chemotherapy!? Luckily the parasite can easily be exterminated with simple antibiotics. ‚Å£
‚Å£
We fell to discover my malignant brain tumour, and I got the tumour to discover the parasite. This begs the question; what‚Äôs next? ‚Å£
‚Å£
Side notet: this parasite is called Cysticercosis and is the first case in West Norwegain historyü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Just over a year ago @sanne.nauta fell 8m and sustained 8-fractures! She spent 2-months in a wheelchair last year... Now she is back in Norway and tour-cycling to her summer job in a mountain lodge.

"I recently finished my 11th out of 12 chemotherapy rounds. It‚Äôs been a vivid and confusing emotional rollercoaster, where I felt a little lost ‚Äì the surgeons removed a golf ball sized tumour in my brain, where my personality was. I used this opportunity to discover new passions, one of them is meditation. After meditating regularly, I realised that pain and suffering is our reset button, similar to the ones on electronic devices. I concluded that it can only get better from now on, until the next tragedy strikes‚Ä¶ -

The lesson is 2/3 of all of us will get a life-threatening disease in our life time, 1/3 of these diseases will be chronic. If you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôll escape, but this only increases the likelihood of a family member, or someone close to you will get a deadly disease."
Despite having gone through 4 surgeries last year I still feel you should do the things you love. A side note, I missed the @LoenSkylift by minutes because of fresh spring snow. So, I had to walk down again, but it didn‚Äôt matter with such a spectacular sunset (image 2)!

"This photo was taken exactly one year ago around the same time when @olegbuller and I took part in the #OrangeTheWorld campaign as a result of Oleg‚Äôs work with the Foreign Ministry. Little did we know that a year later we would actually be working with @UNWOMEN on a global scale to help promote the #OrangeTheWorld campaign via our Foundation @Post.For.Change

This campaign that promotes the empowerment of women in general and stands up against gender-based violence is so close to our hearts that we ask you for your support! The #OrangeTheWorld is a 16 day campaign dedicated to fight gender-based violence by lighting up government buildings, landmarks, and coloring the world Orange, as the color orange symbolizes a brighter future, free of violence.

Violence comes in many shapes and forms. From domestic violence to rape, mental abuse, and legal disparities. We as a global community should not condone, allow or tolerate any form of violence and it needs to stop here! It is 2019 and #timesup.

We urge you to take to your Instagram stories and post about this issue by using our interactive Orange the world filter (which you can find in my profile), as well as the many GIFS that @Unwomen made to make your stories stand out. Small actions can make big impacts to stamp out rape culture and other forms of violence.

Encourage all your friends, colleagues, and family members who believe gender-based violence is wrong and should be eradicated to do the same. I will repost as many as I can so please tag me, tag @post.for.change, tag @unwomen and use the hashtag #OrangeTheWorld !!!"

Last nights Epcot's Candlelight Processional was amazing. For starters we saw guest speaker Whoopi Goldberg. The chorus,the live music, lights even the tree was sybcronized. While free with your Epcot entry this is a event that fills up fast so we went with the dinner package which guarantees us a seat and since @guildagarcia was taking her mom we wanted to be safe.(A event she has been waiting for 14 years) If you saw our stories yesterday  you saw we picked The Garden Grill. There are multiple shows a night which can be combined with various restaurants around Epcot during the day and night so check the My Disney Experience app for options. Both of us agree this is something well worth to do.
Here is Belle  in her stunning Christmas dress. üéÑ  You can find her at the France Pavilion at Epcot.
Belle was enchanting as usual. This is her Christmas dress. üéÑ. Also this is us, thanks for following along.

"O rebaixamento do Cruzeiro √© exclusivo da sua diretoria. Dos roubos denunciados. De avisos de irregularidades que a imprensa cansou de alertar. 
Sempre achamos que servir√° de aprendizado. Mas no futebol brasileiro, meu amigo, isso ser√° repetido diversas vezes.

Que isso, pelo menos, sirva de li√ß√£o ao torcedor para respeitar o jornalismo que investiga e denuncia. E n√£o acharem que h√° persegui√ß√£o a um clube quando apontado os erros.

To date, all the pieces sent to @monicavinader for repair have either been refurbished successfully or recycled. So what Monica is asking of you is to get involved! Re-wear, repair, recycle - if you have any MV pieces at home that you don‚Äôt wear, bring them in to get repaired or recycled. We need to leave behind the culture of throwing away and look at everything we already own with a new, holistic approach #MonicaVinader
I could sit over a fresh coconut water and photograph public beaches all day long. But especially in #Rio, the movement and atmosphere is contagiously energising. Will post tall versions to stories for those who‚Äôve asked for wallpapers üèñ

Cruising round the Thai islands on a yacht.. not sure how I ended up with this kinda life but damn I‚Äôm grateful! It‚Äôs strange, I spent my first 3 years of travel backpacking all around South East Asia, over and over again, I loved it. I‚Äôm based in Bali now and rarely travel around South East Asia.. I think I need to change that in 2020! Check out how I edited this one on my story! And lastly, my editing filters for both Mobile and Desktop are still 30% off but the sale ends tonight.. last chance. Go go go! #linkinbio üòù

I never thought I‚Äôd say this but I‚Äôve been editing my photos a lotttt on my phone lately.

We started the day early to check out Diriyah Gate before the crowds arrived for the evening #diriyahroyalinauguration - After sunrise we went for a quick lunch (and more dates) üòã put on our suits and headed back there just in time for sunset / the evening show! @dgda_sa #dgda
My Bali morning routine üçåüå¥ I love being back on the island and starting my day off with a homemade smoothie!

Depending on temperatures, snowpack, and food supplies Grizzlies are going are going to start thinking about hibernation soon.  The first snows have fallen in the mountains across the west. üêª ‚ùÑÔ∏è üêª ‚ùÑÔ∏è #naturelover #bearsofinstagram #grizzlies
I‚Äôve had so much fun exploring new places lately, almost exclusively on public lands across the west. Where have you been recently that has inspired your adventures?
What‚Äôs your favorite animal?  Mine just might be the elk....for ungulates anyway. Photographed this one with @natgeoexpeditions last summer during a student photo workshop looking for light and exploring the park.
Fall is finally here. Just back from a quick assignment in the desert and drove home through the mountains. It was beautiful seeing the colors everywhere.  Love it when the mornings are hovering right around freezing.
Impact Theory: Lots of talk these days about climate change, especially with the climate strike on everyones mind.  With it, for me anyway comes mixed feelings.  To be honest, I think that we‚Äôve become lost in the ‚Äúawareness age‚Äù. Everyone knows about climate change (wether you support the idea or not), but for some reason we still seem to be relying on the government to solve the problem for us when they have consistently shown us that they won‚Äôt.  I believe that it will only be when the sum of individual actions out weigh the results of marginalized legislation that we‚Äôll start to see the improvements that we‚Äôre seeking.  The government has known about climate change since the 70‚Äôs (at least) with the birth of the modern environmental movement‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs gotten worse not better.  I believe it‚Äôs because we have gotten lost in an ‚Äúawareness vacuum‚Äù. Now we are being taught that liking pictures or using hashtags may actually help somehow.  We have been divided by political parties in the name of power not well being.  Everyone talks about change but either don‚Äôt know what they can do or don‚Äôt care enough to take action.  We are caught in a trap of learned helplessness because we are relying on the government to make it better for us when the reality is only we can save ourselves.  With that I‚Äôll be presenting IMPACT THEORY here on the feed and permanently in my Highlights to give you little ideas on what YOU can do EVERYDAY.  Individual action on a global scale can save us from constant inaction from government or marginalized legislation that can and will change with each new  leadership structure.
"Repost from @thelynxproject So thankful to work with scientists on the ground doing unique and one of a kind research. They are starting to get some tremendous data coming back about the long distance movements of Lynx in the far north. They‚Äôve also been at the forefront of using new ways (social media) to promote, educate and inform the public about their work. Hats off to everyone involved with such a great project. üôå Repost from @thelynxproject using @RepostRegramApp - We capture and collar lynx during the short days and long nights of winter but some of the most interesting things we learn about lynx occur during late spring and throughout the summer and fall months.
.
.
The snowshoe hare population has crashed throughout much of interior Alaska and once the snow began to melt this spring many of our study animals nearly simultaneously began dispersing across much of northwestern North America moving hundreds even more than one thousand miles from where they were captured and collared last winter.
.
.
These cats are swimming across some of the largest rivers on the continent, climbing over massive mountain ranges, visiting the Arctic Ocean and seemingly acting as though nothing can stop them. .
.
There are very real risks to making such incredible movements. Some lynx survive them but others do not.
.
.
Over the course of the next few weeks we‚Äôll describe what we are learning from these truly mind blowing movements, what they may mean, and how what they are showing us can be used to conserve wild places and the many species that depend on these landscapes."

Years ago, one of my first stories was for @thisisflymagazine , about a backcountry fishing trip to the Bahamas.  The images coming from these areas currently are horrific, and the communities there devastated.  The communities that constantly welcome travelers from abroad with open arms can certainly use any help you can give.  Please click the link in my bio to check out a New York Times article on how you can help.
"Repost from @leonardodicaprio using @RepostRegramApp - #Regram #RG @rainforestalliance: 
The lungs of the Earth are in flames. üî• The Brazilian Amazon‚Äîhome to 1 million Indigenous people and 3 million species‚Äîhas been burning for more than two weeks straight. There have been 74,000 fires in the Brazilian Amazon since the beginning of this year‚Äîa staggering 84% increase over the same period last year (National Institute for Space Research, Brazil). Scientists and conservationists attribute the accelerating deforestation to President Jair Bolsonaro, who issued an open invitation to loggers and farmers to clear the land after taking office in January.‚Å£
‚Å£
The largest rainforest in the world is a critical piece of the global climate solution. Without the Amazon, we cannot keep the Earth‚Äôs warming in check. ‚Å£
‚Å£
The Amazon needs more than our prayers. So what can YOU do?‚Å£
‚Å£
‚úî As an emergency response, donate to frontline Amazon groups working to defend the forest. ‚Å£
‚úî Consider becoming a regular supporter of the Rainforest Alliance‚Äôs community forestry initiatives across the world‚Äôs most vulnerable tropical forests, including the Amazon; this approach is by far the most effective defense against deforestation and natural forest fires, but it requires deep, long-term collaboration between the communities and the public and private sectors. ‚úî Stay on top of this story and keep sharing posts, tagging news agencies and influencers. ‚Å£
‚úî Be a conscious consumer, taking care to support companies committed to responsible supply chains.‚Å£ Eliminate or reduce consumption of beef; cattle ranching is one of the primary drivers of Amazon deforestation.
‚úî When election time comes, VOTE for leaders who understand the urgency of our climate crisis and are willing to take bold action‚Äîincluding strong governance and forward-thinking policy.‚Å£

"‚ÄúMy Belief Is Stronger Than Your Doubt‚Äù

7 years ago, I decided to do the unpopular thing - leave the shoe company I was with to sign with @lining.official! I wanted to show the next generation of young people, especially athletes, that it‚Äôs not just one way of doing things.

I had a chance to build ¬†my own brand inside of Li-Ning called Way of Wade, and to have a Global platform that gives future athletes a canvas to create and be expressive. Our motto from day one has been: Make Your Own Way.

My decision 7 years ago was for moments like today. I‚Äôm excited to announce I‚Äôve just signed my first signature athlete - D‚ÄôAngelo Russell. 
@dloading is the perfect player and person to continue the work that I started with @wayofwade. So @dloading here‚Äôs to making your own way...and thank you for believing in us. ü•Ç #MakeYourOwnWay"
If anybody i know deserves the light to shine bright on them it‚Äôs my brother and chef @chefrli ...Thank you @fetelifestylemag for seeing what we see everyday‚ÄºÔ∏è

"happy birthday to this one. this one, AKA lydia night, inspires me to no end, daily. every single day, she teaches me something new about what it means to be a good human, because there‚Äôs no one better at it than her. she is the kindest, most loving, caring, funniest, coolest, most talented, most badass and fucking strongest person i‚Äôve ever known, and there‚Äôs not a second that goes by that i don‚Äôt think of her or how thankful i am to be able to be by her side and learn from her examples. i‚Äôve never been more proud or confident as a result. the world would be much better off if we all took some more cues from her. anyway, yeah, i love ya lyd. everything i do goes back to you. happy birthday‚ù§Ô∏è

Both Shakes have a full slice of Cheesecake blended into them. The Pumpkin Spice also has a slice of Pumpkin Spice Cheesecake on top.

Shoppers in the fancy district of the Vieux Port in Marseille, France in 2011.

Today while the rest of Europe frets over immigration and its impacts, Marseille, France‚Äôs largest city, has built a peculiar cohesiveness out of diversity and difference. The population of nearly one million is the most ethnically diverse in France: a third claim roots in Italy; there are 80,000 Jews making it the third largest Jewish community in Europe; there are 200,000 Africans of which most are Muslim; it has the second largest Armenian population in France; and there are nearly 70,000 Comorians, as many as the capital of this island nation near Madagascar. This m√©lange of identities has created a distinct sense of belonging and pride though it has not been without its challenges. Still it remains strangely immune to ethnic violence. Once famous as being the hang out of the Mafia and a highway for heroin it is on the verge of becoming a hip destination with its broad beaches, world music and international cuisine. And perhaps even a lesson in tolerance for the rest of Europe. Made on assignment for NGM.

Thousands of laborers in this part of India are getting sick with #CKDu, chronic kidney disease of undetermined causes. Dehydration and severe heat exposure are believed to be the leading causes of CKDu. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns in southern India are making working conditions for agricultural laborers even more perilous as CKDu wreaks havoc on individuals, families and communities.

"My image was featured in @natgeo's Best Travel Photos of 2019. This image was made at the Taj Mahal, in Agra, India. This had been my third time visiting this monument and it was the most inspiring visit yet. I was walking the perimeter of the structure, trying to avoid crowds and revel in the artistry and craftsmanship but also the spiritual mood of the place. As I was walking, I was also looking for unique angles or moments, given this is one of the most photographed places on earth. I got to this location as part of a @NatGeo Expeditions Tour that I was leading earlier this year. ‚†Ä

The aftermath of Tavy, or burning of the forest to clear for planting, is illegal but local farmers continue to do this despite the massive reductions of their forests. This tavy is in Manindry Havia. In the distance is one of the few remaining native forests of the region. As the people cut and burn more of their forests, they must go further and further out from their villages to collect wood for their buildings and fires. These images hwere made for the 2010 Prix Pictet Commission, working in cooperation with the United Kingdom based NGO, Azafady, to show issues around land, forests and poverty in this region of Madagascar. The purpose of the images and stories collected here is to illustrate the lack of development and Azafady's efforts to promote sustainable development to improve the lives of the people and how the land is used.  This image was not made on assignment for NGP or NGS.

"[ad] As you might have seen from my stories there is an unmissable festive experience for gin lovers in London - @tanqueraygin have taken over a three-storey house in Bloomsbury where you can relax in a library lounge bar with a delicious cocktail in hand, step into unique sensory experience in a secret bar, discover your flavour profile in the aura room and find personalised Christmas gifts for your family and friends in the gift shop. Open until the 14th December!üç∏üéâüéÑ

"Thank you so much for all your lovely comments when I shared the first photo of my house. Here is another one with a different angle of the beautiful @snugshack sofa [gifted]. When we did the renovations we decided to paint all the walls white but I‚Äôm now thinking that maybe I should change the colour of the wall behind the sofa? What do you think? 
My Christmas tree is not up yet - I can‚Äôt wait to have it in this room!"
One of my favourite Christmas trees in London, but how is it December already?üéÑ

"Every year around Christmas time (or a little earlier) I head to Piccadilly and St James area for some of the most beautiful Christmas displays. I went past @florislondon so many times but somehow have never been inside before. Did you know that it is the oldest English retailer of fragrance and toiletries and is still family owned and run today by the 8th and 9th generation of the family? 
Last week I had an opportunity to step inside this beautiful shop, to learn about its history (it was founded in 1730!) and to try some of my fragrances. There‚Äôs a little museum at the back of the shop where you can see some of the old bottle designs and other historical artefacts. 
I walked out of the shop with a bottle of Bergamotto di Positano perfume [gifted] that has bergamot, green tea and spices in it and would be equally perfect for both winter and summer. I‚Äôve only been wearing it for a few days but have already received a lot of compliments‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ú®"
"I was meant to be in Italy this week but am at home with a cold insteadüò¢
So I‚Äôm taking some time off to rest and hope to be fit again soon just in time for all the festive activities. Here‚Äôs a photo of a bookstore to cheer me and you up‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Breakfast up in the sky is perhaps my favourite kind of breakfast, and even better when it‚Äôs a festive one with a glass of Champagne. @searcysgherkin is now open for breakfast (just for the holiday period) and I was lucky to be one of the first ones to try it [invite].

"To Rest the Soul

Visiting these woods never fails to leave me breathing easier. üíö
I found this tree 5 years ago with a dear friend of mine, and we photographed this very similar scene - however at the time I was using an old camera that couldn't handle the dark lighting so well, so I've been meaning to re-create this image with better tools for 5 years since. I wasn't expecting to finally get this photo yesterday, but as I was driving past this section of the forest I noticed the fog was rolling through in short waves (it's quite elusive right at this spot!) - so Pepper and I parked down the road and hiked into the woods back to this tree. 5 years of waiting down to this moment - I set up the camera, threw on the dress and waited for the next wave of fog, which conveniently rolled in 10 minutes later. So happy it worked out better than I imagined. üòä

"Life has a funny way of being unlike anything you imagine it will be.

After years of dreaming, this year I was finally able to visit my #1 bucket list location - Tombstone Territorial Park.  I was able to reserve permits months in advance, and when August came I drove 45+ hours north into Yukon territory, joined by two of my best friends, ready to hike into the backcountry to spend a week basking in the awe-inspiring, towering presence of the Tombstones and creating a new series of personal photos.

This ended up being the only photo I got. On the second day we were overtaken by a whiteout blizzard, and as we were crossing a boulder field, only half a km from our next tentsite, one of my friends slipped and fell head first several feet down into the sharp boulders, splitting his head open.  Looking back gives me chills to imagine how our situation could have ended much worse - to make a long story short, our radio wouldn't turn on (even though it was fully charged the previous day) and it was immediately apparent we didn't have enough supplies for the medical attention needed. Somehow the adrenaline carried us calmly through - I ran ahead to the tentsite and found a team of park rangers (who were only in the backcountry to re-build part of the trail, thank goodness for their timing!), and with their help we were able to get a helicopter evacuation 3 hours later (major props to the pilot for flying in a blizzard as night fell - apparently the only reason he did was because he had just practiced landing there the night before to prepare for emergencies). We got so lucky in what was an unlucky situation. And yes, 3 months later my friend is still recovering and doing well. üòä

People keep asking if I'm disappointed this dream trip didn't go according to plan - The weird thing is, I'm not. Not in the least.  I've seen up close the dark possibilities of what could have been, with people I care about deeply, and I've come away with a heightened sense of gratitude and much deeper respect. And a reason to someday return and finish what we started. üß°"
"Here silence speaks
Leaving words rendered useless
So be still, my tongue

For the month of November I set myself a little personal challenge of writing one or two haikus with my morning coffee every day... And I've fallen in love with the routine! It surprises me how creating something so short, sweet and simple each morning can really help get my creative brain rolling with inspiration and ideas - and then even if no ideas come to further fruition, I'm at least left with something I created each day that leaves me feeling rewarded. üòä
And I've realized that sometimes it's our smallest creative expressions that can say the most. üß°"
"""We must risk delight. We must have
the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless
furnace of this world.""
- wise words from Jack Gilbert I read this morning.

These last 6 months have been a whirlwind of travels and happenings that have chewed me up and spit me out exhausted, elated, broke, more introspective, thankful, alive, and greatly looking forward to the future. I spent much of this time neglecting emails, messages, social media and basically all the online world -  sorry guys, living really takes it outta me. üòÖ

But now, I'm finally at home again for more than a 3-day stint between travels. I'm finally making time for myself. My introverted spirit is withdrawing into my own quiet, creative world for the rest of November and December.  And I'm so excited to catch up and share it with you all. üòä ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"üôà HOLY MOLY. 
Here‚Äôs a little update on the how the bump & I are tracking along. 
These are the ONLY two bump photos I‚Äôve taken in this 6 month journey so far. And it wasn‚Äôt until I put them side by side that I realised how much he is growing in there üòç

If you missed my update on stories last week, I‚Äôve basically still been here just lurking & creepin‚Äô in the background, but filming workout content and posting on socials has been at the very bottom of my priorities.
I‚Äôm 25 weeks now and still fairly sick, and by fairly sick I mean yesterday I threw up all over myself and my living room rug ü§ü... glorious. 
I‚Äôm still working full time with my clients, keeping my business afloat, I‚Äôm just a whole lot more out of breath demonstrating squats these days üòÖ

I take my hat off to all you mama‚Äôs... pregnancy is NO JOKE.
I really did underestimate how hard this gig would be. 
Working out while pregnant is also SO much harder than I expected. I have really, really struggled to stay in a consistent active routine with my sickness. At most, I try to walk a few times a week and do a light weight / TRX workout from home, because that‚Äôs all this body wants and needs right now. 
I know that once this baby is safely out and we find our groove together, I‚Äôll find my personal groove with harder exercise again. And I‚Äôm SO excited about it all. 
For now, I hope you enjoy following along these changes I‚Äôm experiencing and my journey into a whole new phase of life ü•∞"

"LOWER BODY & SHOULDERS üí™üçë
.
Three movements using just a pair of dumbbells, and you have yourself a sweaty sesh in under 30 minutes. .
Here‚Äôs how I did this one: .
1. Punches x10 + squat x3 - repeat for 90 seconds. 
2. Lunge x2 + lateral raise x2 - repeat for 90 seconds.
3. Lateral step x4 + overhead press x4 - repeat for 90 seconds. .
Rest for 60 seconds between each movement, and repeat all 2-3 more times üëèüî•"

CARDIO LEGS üíÄüí¶ AT HOME!
.

This one is a COMPLETE WORKOUT to torch your legs and make you sweat like crazy. Word of warning; lots of jumping and your heart is going to be pumping! 
Perform these in intervals, with equal work to rest.
.
TOP TIP: remove the jump from all exercisesfor a much more low impact or preggo version! .

1. 40s on 40s off x4
2. 30s per leg with 60s off x3
3. 40s on 40s off x4
4. 30s on 30s off x3 .

Note: this is NOT how I‚Äôm training right now! This body is taking things a lot more easy as it grows, so I‚Äôve been mainly walking, doing body weight low impact movements and doing lighter weights in the gym. .

Filming fresh videos tomorrow, yay! Oh, and I‚Äôll be sporting a new accessory.... ü§∞üôäüòõ"

1. 60 seconds on / 60 seconds off x4 sets

"I‚Äôve been adding @florahealthy Udo‚Äôs Choice Oil Omega 3:6:9 Blend + DHA to my meals each day. This plant-based blend contains unrefined DHA from cultivated algae (which is actually where fish get their DHA!) so it‚Äôs more sustainable, vegan and free of environmental contamination!
Contains: DHA, ALA, & EPA.

Here‚Äôs 3 simple ways you can incorporate Udo‚Äôs Oil into your diet:
1. Add 1 tbsp into your smoothie
2. Swap our 1 tbsp of olive oil for 1 tbsp of Udo‚Äôs Choice in hummus.
3. Add 1 tbsp of Udo‚Äôs Choice to your pesto, which can be added to salads, pasta or toasties (like my vegan toastie recipe in my new book)
4. Add it to any salad dressing.

It does have a nutty, earthy taste so I would recommend half substituting it in a recipe rather than fully substituting the oil such as olive. This oil also should be kept refrigerated and don‚Äôt cook with it, as heat will damage the fatty acids.

"37
‚Ä¢
My mantra for my 37th year. ‚Ä¢
Be yourself
Let your love shine
Say yes, and say no too. 
Be brave in making decisions that feel scary.
Feel more than just content, but radiating gratitude.
37 is sexy!
Keep dreaming big.
Be kind 
Be a good mentor
Feel confident and safe to ask for support.
Be humble.
Go slow, and sometimes go fast too.
Thrive. Dance. Sing. Play.
You are full of magic.

"We spent the final 2 nights of our month long honeymoon at the most beautiful place, @bambuindah .
Nestled in the jungle just outside the hustle of Ubud, Bali, this slice of heaven welcomed us with stellar service, and the most enchanted view.
-
With sustainability and organic design at the heart of their mission, every detail was considered. It was a playful and delightful place to soak up the final two nights in Bali together. We have gathered so much inspiration and I can‚Äôt wait for it all to percolate and brew into something beautiful to share. Haha, even on my honeymoon without my computer I still can‚Äôt help work on something new.... Feeling full of love. #porterkatzhoneymoon"
For our one month wedding anniversary, which falls on the new moon, we designed a flower pool to represent our wedding. The mandala in the center represented the mandala of flowers that @bestdayeverfloraldesign designed for us for our ceremony, and the double rainbow that appeared right after our vows. The feeling of the flowers on my skin was so delightful, it fulfilled a childlike fantasy. üå∏ and sharing it with my love, my husband, as he recounted his experience praying with a local priest, brought tears to my eyes and cracked my heart wide open. #porterkatzhoneymoon photos by @goldenruledesign
A few days spent scooting around Canggu. #porterkatzhoneymoon
I‚Äôve come to this farmers‚Äô market nearly every Sunday for the past six years and today was my last visit (at least while living a few blocks away). I bought produce from the same vendors I always do, but decided not to make them uncomfortable by tearing up while saying goodbye ü§£üò≠. This next week is going to be a doozy since Sloan and I are the two most nostalgic, emotional people and moving is bringing out allllll the feels.
Not packing.
Bought this glitter for Sloan in New Orleans, but as it turns out, we‚Äôre going to be sharing it. Added a little sparkle for tonight‚Äôs date night. ‚ú®
On my way back from Ojai I realized I was about to pass our favorite sandwich shop (which is pretty impressive for me since I‚Äôm directionally challenged) and immediately exited in order to grab lunch. It was just about my proudest moment to date and I got home right as it began to rain and if this isn‚Äôt the best start to the weekend, I‚Äôm not sure what is.
Will never miss an opportunity to wear matching pjs, bake with friends, drink wine by the fire and play games (if you‚Äôve never played Heads Up you‚Äôre missing out). Thank you for the coziest getaway, @eddiebauer! #liveyouradventure #ad
Spent the day outdoors after a week of rain and being cooped up with colds. Couldn‚Äôt be happier to be back in nature with my @eddiebauer family and friends. #liveyouradventure #ad
Sloan stayed home sick from school today and surprising her with sugar cookies to decorate after her nap was the highlight of her (and my) day.üéÑüéÄ‚õÑÔ∏è

"Wow what a week! I‚Äôm absolutely wrecked & about to crash! üò¥ Mia has been sleeping so well lately but last night she was a nightmare!! She screamed for hours & wouldn‚Äôt stop & had a total of maybe 3 hours sleep the WHOLE NIGHT! I‚Äôve weaned her but last night she was screaming so much I didn‚Äôt know what else to do so I let her feed (there‚Äôs no milk left) but she wanted it for comfort I think. It‚Äôs so hard sometimes. üòîI‚Äôm strong most of the time and don‚Äôt give in but when she‚Äôs hyperventilating & extremely stressed & nothing else will help I feel helpless and just give in. üò´ .
Being a mum is the absolute best - I just adore being Mia‚Äôs mama but GOSH it‚Äôs hard sometimes & I just want to bash my head against the wall & question for the millionth time ‚ÄúAm I doing the right thing?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúAm I a good enough mother to Mia?!‚Äù. üò¨üò´
This is normal right? TELL ME WHAT I‚ÄôM FEELING IS NORMAL!! I need validation haha! üôà Seriously though - IT IS TOUGH but so amazing as well. I know I am incredibly blessed to have Mia but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs easy!

"We‚Äôve just landed back in Australia which means I get to see my precious baby girl in only a few hours!! üòÉüôåüèº I am so excited I could cry! I can tolerate a lot & physically I‚Äôm strong but being away from Mia is the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to do. I just crumble. Saying goodbye to her broke my heart, especially when she was looking at me with wide, confused eyes as Daddy carried her away. üò≠ Then we did video calls where she‚Äôd say ‚ÄúMammmaaaaa‚Äù and cry for me then I just lose it! Being a parent is the hardest yet most wonderful thing ever (well I think so anyway) ü§ó I keep telling myself ‚Äúin order to really feel love & happiness you have to allow yourself to feel pain as well. It might seem silly to some but this is how I feel. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Since becoming a mother I‚Äôve changed in so many ways and I‚Äôve become extremely sensitive & emotional. I now cry over things I‚Äôd never cry about before. 
As hard as being away from Mia is, I also feel great comfort in knowing Mia has an amazing dad her takes the best care of her. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

"Do you always find an excuse as to why you can‚Äôt do something? Excuses will always be there ready to be found.
There will always be people who have it ‚Äúeasier‚Äù than you & on the contrary there will always be people who have it ‚Äúharder‚Äù. We all have our own battles in life - mentally, physically & externally. We all have different priorities, tastes & opinions... This is why I believe it is SO important to focus on what YOU are doing & your journey & try not to get distracted by other people. Most importantly don‚Äôt COMPARE to others. 
Comparison is the thief of joy! üòò

I‚Äôm proud of myself & what I‚Äôve achieved in life (I have a hard time being proud of myself but I‚Äôm learning üòâ). I have fought many of my own battles & I‚Äôm currently trying to get my gut health better. I have parasites, SIBO, leaky gut, some nutrient deficiencies & a slow thyroid. - all of this doesn‚Äôt help with my training, mental health & energy BUT I do the best I can. I have body fat & cellulite that won‚Äôt budge & back in the day that would have really got to me but my priorities have changed the older I get & since becoming a mum. Plus I‚Äôm blown away by how strong I am now - physically AND mentally. üí™üèº
.
I know there are millions of people who have it ‚Äúharder‚Äù & have more struggles than me & there are people who have it ‚Äúeasier‚Äù but none of that makes a difference to my journey & my life so I try not to think about that & just focus on getting better, healthier & stronger and being the absolute best I can be. üòäüëäüèº

P.S. Mia doesn‚Äôt care that I have cellulite, stretch marks, wrinkly belly skin, body fat etc. She loves me anyway! üòú

"I KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN CAUSING MY GUT BLOATING/PAIN! - sorry I felt the need to write that in bold! üòù Haha!
In case you didn‚Äôt see my story, I have parasites & SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) & also have been sick from being run down. It‚Äôs a great feeling to know I‚Äôm on the right track to getting my gut healthy again. It may take a long time though (could take a year or so) which is hard since I am a bit impatient, especially about my health. üôà I‚Äôm working on getting rid of the parasites & balancing my good & bad bacteria in my belly. Did you know that you can even have too much of a ‚Äúgood‚Äù strain of bacteria!! I have way too much of the Lactobacillus strains! So I‚Äôve switched my probiotics to one without them! It‚Äôs funny but I‚Äôm so in tune with my body that I had a feeling that was the case! It‚Äôs so good to know for sure. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Your gut microbiota is the name given to the microbe population living in our intestine (we used to call it gut flora).
It consists of trillions of microorganisms and their genetic material that live in our intestinal tract mainly comprising bacteria - or what we commonly refer to as ‚Äúgood & bad bacteria‚Äù. Our microbiome is like an ecosystem which needs diversity. Having good quality probiotics will help ensure you have a diverse blend of the right strains of bacteria so you can have a happy & healthy gut & feel happier & healthier all over.¬†When a specific species in your gut ecosystem are missing your entire system is compromised. That‚Äôs why I believe in changing up your probiotics!
An imbalance of gut bacteria can affect almost everything in your body - even your mood & mental health!

Anyway I could go on and on about this as I find it all so interesting. 
I want to do a podcast episode on ‚Äúgut health‚Äù with a gut health specialist! Would you be interested? .

"Mood quand j‚Äôaimerais qu‚Äôon revienne √† la r√©alit√© sur Instagram et que je puisse me reconna√Ætre dans le contenu que je vois passer.

Ces derniers temps, je me remets encore plus en question sur la mani√®re dont je communique sur les r√©seaux. Je d√©serte Instagram parce que quand j‚Äôy viens, je vois bien que seul le contenu ¬´¬†hype¬†¬ª du moment cartonne, et que si tu ne rentres pas dans les clous, bah tu sombres dans l‚Äôoubli. 
Pour √™tre totalement honn√™te, je suis toujours tiraill√©e entre faire du contenu que j‚Äôaime, et faire du contenu pour que ce soit les autres qui l‚Äôaiment, et d‚Äôailleurs de ce c√¥t√© je suis plut√¥t fi√®re de moi, parce que je reprends souvent le dessus sur ces petites tentations haha.

Pour ces raisons, je r√©it√®re mon engagement √† vous proposer davantage de vrai sur mon compte, des instants de vie sans paillettes et facetune ( seules les couleurs de ces photos ont √©t√© modifi√©es sur Lightroom, mais vous pouvez quand m√™me voir mes taches sur mes joues par exemple )

Ce sont aussi ces raisons qui me poussent √† fuir de plus en plus les soir√©es d‚Äôinfluenceurs, ce monde si petit, plein de r√™ves et de paillettes en fa√ßade mais si n√©faste pour la confiance et le regard sur son apparence et sa vie.

N‚Äôenviez pas la vie de ceux que vous suivez sur les r√©seaux. Un sourire, une tenue, un makeup de ouf, une vie de luxe, des voyages de r√™ve, tout √ßa, ce n‚Äôest pas une r√©alit√© du quotidien. Inspirez-vous en plut√¥t, pour vous pousser √† √™tre la meilleure version de qui VOUS voulez √™tre. Pas la version de ce que vous croyez √™tre la perfection sur les r√©seaux sociaux.

As the days of this decade count down, can we collectively ask, ‚ÄúWhere did time go?‚Äù Those endless summer days of childhood seemed to last forever, yet the older we grow, the busier we become and the quicker the days, weeks, and months seem to fly by. Time is a constant, but our perception of time evolves with age. Why does it seem to pass so quickly for many of us as we get older? More importantly, how do you come to this realization and take steps to become more present and slow it down? One thing that‚Äôs motivated me is thinking of life on a timeline. When you‚Äôre young, traveling and seeing the world isn‚Äôt realistic and when you‚Äôre old, it‚Äôs just not quite the same. We all have a window of our lives to push boundaries, test your limits, and start checking boxes off your bucket list. This past decade was full of self-discovery, challenges, love, and some moments I‚Äôll never forget with friends and family. Can‚Äôt wait to see what the future brings.
It‚Äôs funny how a few nights can alter the course of your life. I remember when I was starting to get into photography, I‚Äôd run to the edge of these cliffs after work almost every day. I grew up in San Diego, but I didn‚Äôt really discover this spot until after college and it always felt so different than every other coastal lookout. It had sweeping views to the south and north, hang gliders soaring through the sky, and surfers running up and down the edges of the cliffs trying to get to one of the best waves in California. I remember that rush each and every day, driving and trying to make sunset, not knowing what it was going to look like of what I could capture. I was hooked. That feeling was the push I needed to change careers and chase that feeling I loved.
I‚Äôve always felt lost with a paintbrush but on nights like tonight, Mother Nature is the best artist anyway.¬†The clouds lit up like brushstrokes, the colors were radiant, and the ocean carried the golden light across each cascading wave.¬†A camera has always been my form of art. Something about thinking through the numbers, settings, and improvising in a fleeting moment has always come across as a challenge. Even though I‚Äôm far removed from my engineering past, it‚Äôs the one time where I feel like world‚Äôs collide and that gives me a unique approach. It‚Äôs a nice reminder to chase things you love and appreciate where your journey has led. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you study one thing yet fall into another path, your journey is what makes you unique and an unmatchable force. Never forget that. Your highs, lows, struggles, triumphs, and everything in between give you something that no one else can match, being you.
This. Morning. Was. Unreal. I rolled over in bed about an hour before sunrise, saw some crazy clouds and thought there might be a chance it would be half this beautiful. Honestly, most the time I go out for sunrise I come home with nothing more than a cup of coffee and a bit let down that I rolled out of bed that early. Mornings like this make up for all the other ones and also make me more appreciative of every day, regardless of the sunrise. Not every morning is gonna light up like this, but each day is a chance to spend with loved ones and work on making yourself the best version of you. That‚Äôs the best treasure of them all üî•
Thankful. For a life of discovering. Most importantly, for a life full of special moments with friends and family. You discover a lot about yourself when you‚Äôre young. You make mistakes. Maybe you pick a career path that might not lead where you expected. You second guess yourself often. Over time though, you start discovering who your true friends are. Maybe they‚Äôve been around since the start, or maybe you find them later in life. Regardless, at some point you realize time is precious and it needs to be spent on those who deserve it. As I‚Äôve gotten older, the one thing I‚Äôve learned most is the memories that stand out aren‚Äôt the experiences I‚Äôve had alone. In the moment they may seem vivid, but their impact fades over time. My favorite memories in life are ones I get to experience with others. Honestly, at the end of the day that‚Äôs all that matters. It‚Äôs being able to look back and laugh at a trip or talk about that one meal that was the best you ever shared. So on this day, I‚Äôm thankful for @kayrubes1, @grahamrubens, and for pictures like these. Because each of these represents a moment shared and a trip I‚Äôll always look back on fondly ‚ô•Ô∏è
Exploring the crystal blue sea caves along the Adriatic coast. It‚Äôs overwhelming planning a vacation with so many beautiful places in this world. I didn‚Äôt even know places like this existed when I was growing up üòÇ Croatia, South Africa, Jordan, French Polynesia...honestly you can‚Äôt go wrong with any choice. Whats the top spot on your bucket list??
"My story starts off the same as many others. I was a kid with a dream of being a professional athlete. I played tennis for almost 20 years, literally until the day I realized I wasn‚Äôt good enough to make it on the pro tour. I always had doubts in the back of my head though, which was the main reason why I studied engineering while playing college sports. Having a back up plan was something I was always taught. As valuable as that ended up being, I sometimes wonder if that was the reason I didn‚Äôt make it. I think having no back up plan can be the spark that ignites a drive beyond what you think you‚Äôre capable of. 
As I began my engineering career, I was once again drawn towards learning things outside my career path. Whether it was finance, entrepreneurship, or creative tasks, it seemed like I was falling into the same pattern. My current chapter is where most of you likely crossed paths with me. Photos, videos, travel, and this whole path Instagram has paved is my present journey, but I can‚Äôt stop the burning desire to pursue things outside of the platform. Maybe it‚Äôll slow down one day and I‚Äôll find my one true calling. For now though, it‚Äôs full speed ahead hitching this ride into the sunset and catching ever detour along the way üòé"
Back in the Middle East, learning about the history of Diriyah Gate and eating as many dates as possible üòç I‚Äôve visited quite a few UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and you can‚Äôt help but appreciate each one‚Äôs uniqueness, history and cultural importance. Being able to attend the #diriyahroyalinauguration is always an honor and the desert landscapes never fail to captivate the imagination. @dgda_sa #dgda
I‚Äôve watched many sunrises in my life, but the view overlooking Guanabara Bay at Mirante Dona Marta has to be one of the most fascinating. It‚Äôs the perfect blend between nature and city, as @kayrubes1 and I watched the twinkle of the lights in the favela below fade off and the mountains catch their first light. What an inspiring spot to start the day on any trip to Rio de Janeiro! I‚Äôve been to Brazil twice these past 12 months and can‚Äôt wait to start getting to other spots of the country üáßüá∑
Some places are beyond words and trying to describe the magic of Iguazu Falls just doesn‚Äôt do this wonder of the world justice. It‚Äôs captivating, powerful, inspiring, and hard to capture the sheer scale and beauty in pictures (but sure fun to try!) Swipe through to the last video to try to count the waterfalls and rainbows that seemingly never end üåà
"Quem j√° experimentou isso? 
Qual li√ß√£o voc√™ aprendeu?

Vamos dividir/compartilhar para aprendermos juntos."
"Quem nunca? ‚†Ä
O problema n√£o √© estar carente, mas se acostumar com isso e ter essa postura por toda a vida.‚Å£‚†Ä
‚Å£‚†Ä
A car√™ncia √© sentir falta de algo que pode ser: aten√ß√£o, carinho, toque f√≠sico, se sentir importante e por a√≠ vai.‚Å£‚†Ä
‚Å£‚†Ä
Esse status √© preocupante porque o carente n√£o avalia consequ√™ncias e muitas vezes abre m√£o de valores para se satisfazer.‚Å£‚†Ä
‚Å£‚†Ä
Quero te dar 4 dicas para lidar com a car√™ncia:‚Å£‚†Ä
‚Å£‚†Ä
1) Desenvolva o auto conhecimento: conhe√ßa seus limites, suas atitudes e isso pode te livrar de muitas furadas.‚Å£‚†Ä
‚Å£‚†Ä
2) Busque a causa: a car√™ncia √© um sintoma. Investigar a origem e saber que s√≥ voc√™ pode resolver isso ajuda a ter uma nova perspectiva.‚Å£‚†Ä
‚Å£‚†Ä
3) Primeiros socorros - tenha o seu sempre √† m√£o. Amigos para te ouvir, uma atividade f√≠sica para gastar energia, uma boa s√©rie, livros, medita√ß√£o, um lugar legal pra ir... combata a car√™ncia com a sua intelig√™ncia.‚Å£‚†Ä
‚Å£‚†Ä
4) Ningu√©m pode ter tudo ent√£o NINGU√âM TE DEVE NADA! Car√™ncia n√£o se supre, car√™ncia SE CURA e o in√≠cio desse processo √© saber que ningu√©m me deve nada.‚Å£‚†Ä
‚Å£‚†Ä
Que possamos nos conhecer mais a cada dia e caminhar juntos rumo √† plenitude. ‚Å£‚†Ä
‚Å£‚†Ä
Um forte abra√ßo e vamos juntooooos.‚†Ä

"T√£o maravilhoso ver a fidelidade de Deus, a alegria de colher os frutos da confian√ßa e obedi√™ncia! ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Emocionante (chorei litros) testemunhar essa cerim√¥nia que foi recheada de significado. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Mas n√£o se engane ao ver as fotos rom√¢nticas e as filmagens cheias de emo√ß√£o, pra chegar at√© aqui existe um caminho, com escolhas dif√≠ceis, l√°grimas e desafios; n√£o existe caminho f√°cil, voc√™ precisa escolher qual pre√ßo quer pagar. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
A vida de independ√™ncia ou de obedi√™ncia √† vontade de Deus trar√£o dificuldades, lutas e dor, a diferen√ßa estar√° nos frutos, viver a independ√™ncia trazem frutos moment√¢neos, mas a obedi√™ncia a Deus trazem frutos eternos. ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Ver a @marcelataisoficial ler para o @samuel.ant a carta que ela escreveu para seu marido a 19 anos atr√°s me fez pensar no desafio que √© permanecer firme e obedecer aos princ√≠pios de Deus, um looongo caminho ela precisou percorrer, testemunhamos que em partes desse caminho. Ela precisou de uma boa pitada de coragem e um caminh√£o de f√©!‚†Ä
‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Agora chegou a hora de desfrutar das escolhas que voc√™ fez! Que sejam felizes para sempre.‚†Ä

"I travel a lot for work, and sometimes being on the road can be lonely and make home feel painfully far away. There's one place that's different, though, and has always felt like a home-away-from-home since the beginning. @Villa_sancta_maria is my special little slice of heaven, perched atop a hilltop in western Croatia, and it's where I close my eyes and imagine myself whenever I'm stressed or overwhelmed. üïä
.
This beautiful old stone farmhouse has seen so many incredible women pass through it over the past 5 years of hosting retreats there. So many different conversations gathered around @tournantpdx's fire in the hearth of the kitchen, stomachs full with their delicious food, laughter echoing through the living room. üçá
.
From sitting by the pool soaking up the view, to relaxing on the balcony with some local Istrian wine, there's no place I'd rather be at any given moment. The house just has this warm welcoming feeling that instantly puts me at ease...it feels like an emotional hug right when you walk through the door. üíö
.
Whenever I'm gone, I miss @villa_sancta_maria so, so much‚Äîbut I can always look forward to next year's visit. I can't imagine a year not coming to this special place, it's like a creativity pilgrimage that my mind and body need. And I can't wait to visit again in May when @bealubas and I are hosting *two* workshops there together. If you want to be emailed when registration opens the week after next, you can join the mailing list via the link in my profile!üëÜüèº

Wishing you a long relaxing weekend + dreams of places like this ü•∞

It's been really busy here work-wise, so the garden chores have been on the back-burner a bit. But I've also just really enjoyed staying warm + cozy inside, drinking lots of tea, and petting the animals. üêïüê∂üêà

It's hard to push yourself to go work outside in the cold when it's oh-so-comfy indoors! But seriously guys, this weekend. This weekend I *will* catch up on my winterizing chores. Really. I will. But first, maybe some tea... ‚òïÔ∏èü•∞

If you haven‚Äôt joined yet, I want to address some of the most common questions that have come up about it, and if you have another question feel free to leave it in the comments below + check out some of the Q&A's I've been doing in my IG stories, too! üëÜüèº
.
Q: I am so overwhelmed, I just don‚Äôt know if I have the time for something like this right now. üï∞
.
A: Time is not something you have to worry about with my course. You get lifetime access, you can go at your own pace, everything from videos to pdfs can be downloaded, there is no rush whatsoever. I want you to go at the pace that works best for you to *learn*. üí°
.
Q: I‚Äôve done an online course before with someone else and was really underwhelmed. üôÅ
.
A: I totally get that. But in my case, I've taught **thousands of hours of courses**, both online and in person. Half the attendees of my advanced Croatia retreat were repeat students from previous entry level workshops I've taught. What I teach and *how* I teach truly resonates with my students. üôåüèº
.
I‚Äôm an open book and I share *everything* about creating beautiful images with you in this course. But you DON'T have to take it from me! There‚Äôs many, *many* testimonials from happy + gifted students on the course page, and you can read through them via the link in profileüëÜüèºüë≠ü§∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë≠

"Holy moly, guys! üòÜ I'm doing a two-part post series today + tomorrow to address some of the most common questions that have come up about my signature Photography + Styling + Branding Course! There's lots of deets via the link in profile, too! üëÜüèº Let's dive in! ‚ö°Ô∏è
.
Q: I‚Äôm definitely curious about improving my photography + overall visual branding. I want to do this, but I don‚Äôt know if I have a good enough camera.
.
A: If you tuned into my lighting masterclass, you know that there is SO much more that goes into creating a beautiful image than just the fancy expensive gear you have (my lighting kit totals around $41). In the course I‚Äôll explain why some cameras cost a lot more than others (hint! It has to do with something called a sensor), and some work arounds for older DSLR cameras that might not have certain setting options. üì∏
.
Q: How long is the course?
.
A: There‚Äôs over 5 hours of video content, with assignments for you to complete paired with each lesson, so it will take time to work through it, but a very *manageable* amount of time. I specifically created this course to be approachable and *give you results in the shortest amount of time possible*. Let‚Äôs sit crooked and talk straight‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to give you fluff. I know your time is valuable, and I don‚Äôt want to waste it with irrelevant side tracks + long boring monologues. Everything in the course has been distilled down to help you LEARN and IMPROVE as *quickly and simply* as possible. ‚è≥
.
Stay turned for another double-dose of questions tomorrow, and if you have any other questions about the course feel free to reply below with your Q! ü•∞

In the masterclass, I give you the skills to take beautiful flattering images of absolutely any subject, regardless of your equipment or location, by directing natural light. I show you my lighting kit, and how affordable it is for anyone to put together. And I dispell some of the myths about lighting for dark vs light styles of photography. üåó
.
If you just put those new skills to use on your brand and start quickly taking images with killer dynamic lighting, that‚Äôs awesome and I‚Äôm *so* happy to be able to help!! üëèüèº

But if you want to keep this journey of speedy and straightforward improvement going, I am here waiting for you at the open door to my signature Photography, Styling, and Branding Course for just FOUR more days! üéâ

If you can't make it live, no worries! I'll send you a replay link so you can still catch all the goodness! ü§©
.
I really love playing with the dynamic between light and dark images. Even though my personal preference is to go dark + moody, I like shooting brighter images to push myself outside of my set 'style', and to make my brain create in new and different ways than what it's always comfortable with. üåó

Petrel Cove ruggedness from last week. This weekend got off to a rough start with our youngest fracturing her elbow but fingers crossed for a good operative result ! #everlookphotography #southaustralia #australia #seeaustralia #fleurieupeninsula #victorharbor #landscapephotography #naturephotography #longexposure @nisiglobal @nisifiltersaustralia
Dawn at Petrel Cove was a nice one today, good at any tide ! #everlookphotography #australia #southaustralia #seeaustralia #victorharbor #petrelcove #sunrise #sunset @nisiglobal @nisifiltersaustralia
Low flow at Horseshoe Falls earlier this year. Though summer isn‚Äôt waterfall season , I‚Äôm hoping there will be some flow in the Otways ! #everlookphotography #australia #seeaustralia #tasmania #discovertasmania #waterfall #horseshoefalls #mountfieldnationalpark #forest  @nisiglobal @nisifiltersaustralia #nisifiltersanz
Beauchamp Falls was one of our fave spots from the 2015 road trip we took. This year, I hope to visit some lesser known falls though Beauchamp and Hopetoun May get a rerun with the kids ! Only 3 weeks to go ! #everlookphotography #victoria #seeaustralia #australia #greatoceanroad #otwaysnationalpark #beauchampfalls #waterfall
The leaning dolorite towers of South Wellington were an amazing place to explore on a blazing gusty morning back in April this year. @nisifiltersaustralia @nisiglobal #everlookphotography #kunyani  #mountwellington #hobart #tasmania #discovertasmania #landscape #earth #seeaustralia #sunrise #dawn #naturephotography
Hope everyone had a great weekend! I‚Äôve been planning our next trip along the limestone coast and hope to explore the Otways too.

Another of my favourite coastal locations is Tongaporutu on the west coast of New Zealand . This ever changing location is subject to some potentially risky tides so I played it safe with the kids in tow and visited during a very low tide in 2018. #newzealand #kiwiphotos #purenewzealand #tongaporutu #threesisters #newplymouth #northisland #seascape #landscape #everlookphotography @nisifiltersaustralia @nisiglobal

"Today I want to focus on one my favorite world heritage sites: The V√∂lklingen Ironworks in Saarland, Germany. ‚†Ä‚†Ä
The site is a decommissioned ironworks which was in operation from 1881 to 1986. ‚†Ä‚†Ä
This site is really impressive. It is right out of central casting for how an old factory should look and feel. It looks like something out of the last scene of Robocop. ‚†Ä‚†Ä
Supposedly, it was declared a World Heritage Site because it was cheaper to make it a world heritage site than it was to tear it down. It is good that they didn‚Äôt tear it down, because there are so few facilities like there where you can get a real visceral feel for what late 19th and early 20th century ironworking was like.‚Ä®‚†Ä‚†Ä‚Ä®The V√∂lklingen Ironworks was the very first industrial world heritage site.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
The area around it is still used to create iron and steel. I saw railcars carrying molten iron from one facility to another while I was there.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
If you are at all interested in industrial history, I‚Äôd HIGHLY recommend a visit. It is a fascinating place and there are few other environments like in the world. ‚†Ä‚†Ä
#everythingeverywhere #curiositynow #unesco #visitgermany #germanytourism #worldheritage #unescoworldheritage #worldheritagesite #v√∂lklingen"
"I‚Äôm going to feature something this week which might not be that popular, but something I think is both important and interesting.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Industrial History.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
We people visit historic sites, they are usually visiting ancient ruins, cathedrals or temples, or city centers that are several hundred years old. All of those are fine things and I‚Äôve certainly visited my fair share of them.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
One thing I always like visiting are the overlooked sites which help us understand how our modern world came about. Everything isn‚Äôt churches and museums. Ore had to be mined and processed to make metals. Techniques had to be developed to create machines. Roads and railways had to be laid down.‚Ä®‚†Ä‚†Ä‚Ä®One reason people don‚Äôt visit these places is because they usually aren‚Äôt preserved. Few people thought to preserve a factory from the 19th or early 20th century. That isn‚Äôt old enough to be ‚Äúhistory‚Äù.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
The first site I‚Äôm going to feature is the copper mine in Falun, Sweden. The mine operated for almost 1,000 years, only ceasing production in 1992.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
In the 17th century, the mine was responsible for the vast majority of copper in Europe, and was the single biggest revenue source for the Kingdom of Sweden.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Working in the mine hundreds of years ago was horrific. Large fires were lit inside to crack the rock so it could be extracted. Miners would often go months without seeing daylight. ‚†Ä‚†Ä
The mine tour is fascinating and gives you a look into how mining was conducted centuries ago. The area around the mine was originally built for mine workers, but today it is just regular housing for people in the city. ‚†Ä‚†Ä

"Today I‚Äôm heading back to North America to talk about another park which few people are aware of. It has been called the Galapagos of North America, and it is one of the most wild, unique ecosystems on the planet.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Gwaii Haanas National Park.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Gwaii Haanas is the southern third of the Haida Gwaii Islands (aka the Queen Charlotte Islands) off the coast of British Columbia. (The last image shows where the park is on a map.)
‚†Ä‚†Ä
The park can only be visited by boat or by float plane. There no roads to the park, and it wouldn‚Äôt really even be possible given that the park is a collection of islands.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
In the park you will see sea lions and sea otters, as well as black bears, deer, and lion jellyfish. The landscape is also stunning with mountains meeting the sea.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
As amazing as the natural beauty of the park is, the cultural significance of the park might even be greater.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
The park has several Haida villages which were abandoned in the early 20th Century during an outbreak of smallpox. The sites of the villages have been allowed to return to nature, and most of them are now just hollowed out sections of forests, with some potlatch poles.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
The most significant village is SGÃ±ang Gwaay, which has the last, original standing pre-European totem poles in the world. The Haida people believe that totem poles have a life like people, so they are being allowed to decay naturally. They clear brush around the poles, but other than that they are being allowed to decay.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Given the cold waters of the area, even if you visit in the middle of the summer, the boat trips to the park can be quite cold.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
The launching point for visiting the park are the towns of Masset and Port Clements, and the airport on the island is Sandspit (YZP).

"I‚Äôm sure everyone who is reading this is familiar with Uluru, aka Ayer‚Äôs Rock, in Australia.
‚†Ä
What you might not know is that the official name of the park it is located in is Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park.
‚Ä®So what is with the Kata Tjuta part? That is focus on today‚Äôs post. 
There are actually TWO massive rocks out in the middle of the Australian outback. Uluru I‚Äôm not going to focus on too much because it is well known. The other is called Kata Tjuta. (To be technical, Kata Tjuta isn‚Äôt one rock. It is a collection of them.) The two rocks are not far apart from each other. Kata Tjuta is visible from Uluru and vice versa. Unlike Uluru, it isn‚Äôt quite one massive rock. It has large cracks and crevices that you can walk in.

The highest point of Kata Tjuta is actually higher than Uluru. 
Most visitors to the park visit Uluru and nothing else. The number of people who take the time to visit Kata Tjuta is significantly less than the number that go to Uluru. During my first trip to the park in 2008 we didn‚Äôt visit Kata Tjuta and no one even mentioned it.

On my second trip there in 2013, we visited during one of our days and it was a great experience, with very few people. Uluru can be incredibly crowded at sunrise and sunset, where as Kata Tjuta is pretty much empty.

If you are going to travel all the way to the middle of Australia, you owe it to yourself to see both parts of the park. 
FYI, the last image in this set is a public domain photo taken from the International Space Station in 2010. I added it just do you can get a better idea of what the area is like.

"My overlooked destination today is found in Japan. One of the reason few people outside of Japan know about it is that it is well off the typical tourist route. You can‚Äôt get there by train, and in fact it isn‚Äôt even connected to the main four islands in Japan. It is a place ‚†Ä
I‚Äôm am talking about Yakushima. ‚†Ä
Yakushima is an island about 140km (80mi) south of Kagoshima, Japan, which is the southernmost major city in the main Japanese island group.
‚†Ä
What makes Yakushima so special? The center of the island, on the top of the volcanic peak, is an old growth cedar forest. Due to its island location, there is no recorded history of logging ever in this part of the island. The elevation on the mountain means it is often in the clouds, and all of the trees are surrounded by mist.
‚†Ä
The forests are stunningly beautiful. The only other place I‚Äôve found similar to this would be Olympic National Park in Washington State, or some coastal areas of British Columbia. ‚†Ä‚Ä®When I visited Yakushima back in 2007, I did not encounter another non-Japanese person during my entire visit. In fact, despite not a single person at my hotel on the island knowing English, I had one of the best meals in my life in Yakushima. ‚†Ä
The island was the inspiration for Hayao Miyazaki's animated film Princess Mononoke.
‚†Ä
Most people who visit Japan have a set list of sites they visit which include Kyoto, Nara, Tokyo, and some places in-between. They might go a bit beyond this, but most visitors aren‚Äôt going to go further south than Fukuoka. ‚†Ä
You can get to Yakushima via direct flights from Osaka or Fukuoka, or you can take the ferry from Kagoshima which takes about 2-3 hours. There are also car ferries which go to Yakushima as well if you are driving.
‚†Ä
While on the island, you can get around via rental car (what I did) or via bus, which will take you to the major forest groves on the island.
‚†Ä
Yakushima was the highlight of my time in Japan, and a place which few people I have met since have visited or even heard of.
‚†Ä

"I was thinking of which lesser known destinations to feature. The truth is, there are a LOT of them. The planet is littered with amazing places few people bother to visit.

This week I really want to feature places that evoke a response of ‚ÄúWHY DIDN‚ÄôT I KNOW ABOUT THIS??‚Äù One of those places is again in Italy. Most of the attractions in Italy either date back to the Roman period, or to the Renaissance. This place dates back to the 18th Century, which isn‚Äôt one of the best known periods in Italian history.

Back then, most royals in Europe had Versailles envy. The palace of the King of France was the standard by which palaces were judged. Many other monarchs created palaces which emulated Versailles. Sch√∂nbrunn Palace in Vienna is probably one of the best examples of this.

The King of Naples didn‚Äôt want to be outdone, so they created the Italian version of Versailles. 
The Royal Palace of Caserta.

When I visited, I was on a group tour of Italy, and only one other person on the tour bothered to come with me. When I got there, there were almost no non-Italian tourists.

In terms of total volume, it is the largest royal palace in the world.  The palace is five stories tall, has over 1,200 rooms, and has over 1,700 windows. 
The gardens are what is really amazing. There is an aqueduct running through the garden which is a total of 38km long! From the back of the palace it extends out to the horizon.

Getting to Caseata is actually really easy. The train station is literally outside the palace.

#everythingeverywhere #curiositynow #italy #caserta #unesco #unescoworldheritage #worldheritage #worldheritagesite"
"Today I want to feature a place which most of you have probably heard of, but I‚Äôm guessing only a few of you have actually visited.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Unlike yesterday‚Äôs destination, this one is very easy to reach, however, it happens to be overshadowed by a much more popular neighbor, Venice.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
I‚Äôm talking about the city of Padua (or Padova in Italian).
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Padua is only a 20 minute train ride from Venice. Of the 20,000,000 people who visit Venice every year, only a small faction ever bother to make the short trip to Padua. The cost of a ticket from Venice to Padua can be had for as little as ‚Ç¨3.55 ($4), and trains leave at least once or twice and hour all day long.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Why take the time to visit Padua?
‚†Ä‚†Ä
1. Padua has the largest city square in Europe. The Prato della Valle is a 90,000¬†m2¬†square in the shape of an oval, which is surrounded by 78 statues of famous citizens. ‚†Ä‚†Ä
2. It has the world‚Äôs oldest botanical garden. The Orto Botanico di Padova was found in 1545 and today is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The garden is small by today‚Äôs standards, but it is open to the public. ‚†Ä‚†Ä
3. One of the finest decorated churches in Europe. The Scrovegni Chapel has an interior which is covered in frescos by the artist Giotto. Completed in 1305, the number of visitors allowed to enter daily is limited. Visitors must first enter a climate controlled, airlock room to prevent temperature fluctuations in the church. During the temperature acclamation period, you watch a video about the history of the church. Make sure to book your tickets in advance.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
4. One of the most significant churches in Italy. The Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua is the resting place of the saint, and is one of only eight national shrines in the world recognized by the Vatican.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
5. One of the best Astronomical clocks in Europe. You might be familiar with the famous clock in Prague. Pauda has one of their own in the Piazza dei Signori.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
6. One of the oldest universities in the world. The University of Padua is the 5th oldest surviving university in the world. Noted faculty have included Galileo and noted alumni include Copernicus.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Yes, Venice is very beautiful, but it is also extremely crowded. Try Padua"
"This week I want to do the exact opposite of what I did last week. Last week I focused on popular tourist destinations around the world. This week I want to focus on lesser known places that most people aren‚Äôt aware of.
‚†Ä
I want to start with a place which I‚Äôve featured on Instagram before, but I don‚Äôt know if many people are really aware of just how amazing this place is.
‚†Ä
That place is Nahanni National Park.‚Ä®‚†Ä‚Ä®Nahanni might be the greatest national park in the world. Please re-read the last sentence again. I don‚Äôt make that claim lightly as I‚Äôve been to many parks all over the world.
‚†Ä
Despite being one of the world‚Äôs greatest national parks, it gets very few visitors. In an average year fewer than 1,000 people will enter the park. Most Canadians I‚Äôve spoken with have never heard of the park.
‚†Ä
The lack of visitors and awareness of the park is mostly due to its location. It is in the Northwest Territories of Canada and there are no roads connecting the park to the rest of the world. The only way to visit is via float plane or to hike in. It also has a very short season for visitors given its location. It is accessible for only about 3 months per year.
‚†Ä
The park is the location of one of the largest waterfalls in the world; Virginia Falls. The World Waterfall Database lists it as the 7th highest rated waterfall in the world!
‚†Ä
But wait, there‚Äôs more!
‚†Ä
There park is so much more than just a big waterfall. It has canyons, specular mountains, a huge river, and tons of wildlife. Its remoteness means that if you visit, you get an experience which is totally different than what you will have if you go to Banff, Yosemite, or Yellowstone. ‚†Ä

"Sydney is always ranked as one of the best cities in the world in terms of standard of living. I can‚Äôt really argue with that.

In addition to being a great place to live, it is also a great place to visit. For most visitors to Australia, Sydney will be the first stop in their visit as it has the largest airport in the country.

Any visit to Sydney will start in the harbor, where you can find two of the most well known attractions in Australia: The Sydney Opera House and the Harbor Bridge.

Despite being built less than 50 years ago, the Opera House is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has become the symbol for the city. ‚Ä®Not far from the opera house is the Sydney Harbor Bridge. It is one of the largest steel arch bridges in the world and it is possible to do a bridge walk that takes you to the top of the bridge. 
Another great attraction that few people know about is Cockatoo Island, which is located in the harbor. It is a former prison and shipyard, which today is one of the only places you can camp in the middle of Sydney. You can easily get there by ferry. ‚Ä®Manly beach is one of the most best beaches in Sydney and is a popular surfing location. 
Sydney is also the location of the biggest fireworks show in the world every New Year‚Äôs Eve. I was there for it in 2014 and I had to wait for most of the day to get a good seat.

#EverythingEverywhere #curiositynow #Paris #france #unseco #worldheritage"
"Paris. This will be hard to fit into 2,200 characters.
‚†Ä
The Paris that most people visit today is largely a 19th Century creation. In 1853 Emperor Napoleon III commissioned Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann to head a project which radically changed the city. Avenues were widened, neighborhoods were demolished, and the layout of what is Paris today is largely the result of this effort.
‚†Ä
Many of the most iconic buildings in Paris were built during this time, including the Haussmann apartment buildings which are everywhere in Paris, lining most of the streets. The iconic octagonal kiosks were also introduced during this time.
‚†Ä
The Louvre is a major exception to this of course. It was originally built as a palace for the King of France in the 12th and 13th Centuries, but when Louis XIV moved to Versailles, the palace became mostly a place for the royal collection of art. It officially became a museum open to the public during the French Revolution in 1793.
‚†Ä
The Arc de Triomphe was commissioned in 1806 after the Battle of Austerlitz by Napoleon Bonaparte, but it wasn‚Äôt completed until 1836. It has since been used to honor the French war dead from WWI and is the location of the French Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
‚†Ä
The Eiffel Tower was originally built for the 1889 World‚Äôs Fair was intended to be taken down after the fair was over. It was so popular, it remained and has become the symbol of the city.
‚†Ä
The Cathedral of Notre Dame was completed in the 13th century and was seriously damaged by fire this past April. The French parliament passed a law in July requiring that the cathedral be repaired to look exactly like it did before. ‚†Ä
Paris is currently the second most visited city in the world with 19 million annual visitors (Bangkok is now #1). It was the most visited city in the world for several decades.
‚†Ä
#EverythingEverywhere #curiositynow #Paris #france #unseco #worldheritage"
"Venice is one of the most popular, and perhaps overvisited, tourist destinations in the world.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
The location of Venice on a series of islands in a lagoon was selected as people sought protection from invading Germanic tribes in the late Roman Empire.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
The location turned out to be a great base for the creation of a maritime trading empire. As Venice grew rich in the 9th to 13th centuries, they expanded controlling many cities along the Adriatic and Mediterranean coasts. In the 13th Century, it was the richest city in Europe.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
St. Mark‚Äôs Cathedral and St. Mark‚Äôs Square are named after the St. Mark, one of the authors of the New Testament gospels, which is buried in the cathedral. His body was taken from Alexandria, Egypt in 828. The relics were supposedly smuggled out of Alexandria underneath ‚†Ä‚†Ä
The leader of Venice was called the Doge. The Doge was elected for live in one of the most complicated election systems ever devised, where random names where chosen, who were randomly reduced, who then elected people, who then were randomly reduced, who then elected people, who were randomly reduced, who then elected the Doge.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
The system was designed such that no powerful family could possibly control the outcome given the random nature of selecting the electors. The system worked for over 500 years.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Venice lasted as an independent republic until 1797 when it was conquered by Napoleon in the War of the First Coalition.
‚†Ä‚†Ä
Today you can see evidence of the Venetian Empire all along the coast in places such as Croatia, Montenegro, and Greece. ‚†Ä‚†Ä

"This week I'm not going to have a theme, but rather give you some interesting facts about some of the best-known tourist destinations in the world.

The Vatican is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Rome, and it has a really interesting history which most visitors are probably totally unaware of. 
1) The St. Peter's Basilica is located where is it because it is believed to be the burial spot of St. Peter. 
2) The original building, now known as Old St. Peter's, existed from the 4th to 16th century. It was originally commissioned by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great.

3) The Egyptian obelisk in the middle of St. Peter's Square is there because it supposedly was present at the crucifixion of St. Peter in the Circus of Nero. The obelisk is the oldest standing obelisk in Rome and has only been moved once, during the creation of St. Peter's Square. It was quarried approximately 4,000 years ago near Heliopolis, Egypt.

4) An excavation under St. Peter's conducted in 1942 found the remains of a Roman cemetery directly under the altar, which is also where the altar of the original basilica was. There were etchings on the walls which pointed to the gravesite of ""Petrus"". There were several bone fragments found which are believed to be the remains of St. Peter.

5) Much of the marble which clad the Colosseum was used in the creation of St. Peter's Basilica. Many Roman ruins in the city were used as an easy source of marble.

6) Despite being over 400 years old, St. Peter's Basilica is still the largest church in the world by total interior area.

7) Vatican City is an independent country. This unique status was created as a compromise with Italy in 1929. Prior to the Lateran Treaty which created Vatican City, for almost 60 years, popes refused to leave the walls of the Vatican in protest of the dissolution of the Papal States.

8) The Vatican has about 800 citizens, however, none of them are natives and the country has a birth rate of zero.

9) The Vatican controls many buildings in Rome. Many major churches such as St. Paul's and St. Mary's are controlled by the Vatican and have the same legal status as an embassy.

10) The Vatican isn't part of the"

"FEATURED PHOTO OF THE WEEK: This has to be the most amazing photo I have ever seen of volcanic lightning discharged from an erupting volcano, also known as a ‚ÄúDirty Thunderstorm‚Äù. The Calbuco volcano erupted on April 22, 2015 (Earth Day) in southern Chile. Volcanic lightning occurs when fragmented particles collide in the volcanic plume and generate static electricity.

"You have to remember that the hard days are what make you stronger.
The bad days make you realize what a good day is.
If you never had any bad days, you would never have that sense of accomplishment
I want to change the world, and do something valuable and beautiful.
I want people to remember me before I'm dead, and then more afterwards.
My goal is that after I am dead and gone, I want people to remember me for the person I am.
Teaching is a very noble profession that shapes the character, caliber, and future of an individual. 
If the people remember me as a good ‚Äûteacher‚Äú, that will be the biggest honour for me.
We do not remember days, we remember moments and acts that leaves an impact on someone!

AMG GT R Roadster ""The Beast of The Green Hell"".
AMG. Driven By The Inner Force.

Next Level of Driving Performance.

The AMG M178 4.0L biturbo engine in the AMG GT R has an output of 585hp and the peak torque of 700Nm is available between 1,900 and 5,500rpm. The AMG 4.0L V8 engine features the tried and tested twin turbochargers, which are not mounted on the outside of the cylinder banks but rather inside the V¬†configuration ‚Äì experts call it a ‚Äúhot inside V‚Äù. This basic principle of the new AMG V8 family has been further optimised for the AMG GT R. The seven-speed dual-clutch transmission configured in a transaxle layout at the rear axle has likewise been extensively revised by the AMG developers to make the transmission even more suitable for the racetrack. Drivers can tailor the AMG GT R to their personal preferences using the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT controller. Various modes are available: ‚ÄúC‚Äù (Comfort), ‚ÄúS‚Äù (Sport), ‚ÄúS+‚Äù (Sport Plus) and ‚ÄúI‚Äù (Individual).

"I am convinced that attitude is the key to success or failure in almost any of life's endeavors.
Your attitude-your perspective, your outlook, how you feel about yourself, how you feel about other people-determines you priorities, your actions, your values.
Your attitude determines how you interact with other people and how you interact with yourself.
Our attitudes control our lives.
Attitudes are a secret power working twenty-four hours a day, for good or bad.
It is of paramount importance that we know how to harness and control this great force.
Ability is what you're capable of doing.
Motivation determines what you do.
Attitude determines how well you do it.
The greatest day in your life and mine is when we take total responsibility for our attitudes.

The new AMG GLC63 ""The Performance SUV"".
For the first time, a mid-size SUV is now also available with the powerful eight-cylinder biturbo in two output variants. The basis for this is provided by the M177 AMG 4.0‚Äëlitre V8 engine with 350kW (476hp) or 375kW (510hp) in the GLC63¬†S and GLC63¬†S Coup√© variants. Acceleration from 0‚Äë100¬†km/h in just 3.8¬†seconds also impressively demonstrates: the new SUVs hold a special position in their market segment.

The Performance SUVs also feature air spring suspension with adaptive adjustable damping, AMG Performance 4MATIC+ all-wheel drive with fully variable torque distribution, a rear-axle limited-slip differential and a high-performance braking system. As a visual indication of their links with Mercedes-AMG sports cars, the new models sport the AMG Panamericana grille, which was previously reserved for the AMG GT family. In addition, the new models offer all the advantages of a Mercedes-SUV: ample room for passengers and luggage, comprehensive array of safety equipment and superior traction, also in the wet or in wintry road conditions.

AMG GT R Pro ""The Monster of The Green Hell""
The new limited-edition top-of-the-range model AMG GT R PRO is characterised by yet further improved driving dynamics, in particular on the racetrack. The experience from the AMG GT3 and AMG GT4 racing cars entered into the development. The measures from motorsport can be clustered in four areas: suspension, lightweight construction, aerodynamics and looks.
Suspension: the optimal set-up

The new AMG coil-over suspension offers even more choices for tailoring the set-up to the particular circuit. As in professional motorsport, the driver is not only able to set the spring preload length mechanically, but can now also adjust the compression and rebound of the dampers. This is done quickly and precisely without tools via a click system with an integral adjustment dial on the damper. The compression rate is adjusted separately for high-speed and low-speed movements. This means that the settings can be dialled-in for slow and fast compression movements as is common practice in motorsport. This allows influencing the body dive and roll as the well as the traction of the AMG GT R PRO even more selectively.
The front axle is fitted with an adjustable torsion bar made of lightweight carbon fibre. Its counterpart at the rear is made of steel, is likewise adjustable and also saves weight due to its hollow tube design.
The AMG GT R is already fitted with Uniball spherical bearings at the lower wishbones of the rear axle. The AMG GT R PRO now gets these bearings also for the upper wishbones. They are significantly more wear-resistant than conventional wishbone bearings and due to their design have no play, which means toe-in and camber do not change even under high loads.

O que est√° por tr√°s dessa escolha? Em um momento de grande instabilidade pol√≠tica global, em que a verdade est√° sendo substitu√≠da por fake news fabricadas por ve√≠culos de propaganda em massa, e as incertezas e a falta de um caminho certo nos deixa inseguros e ansiosos, a ado√ß√£o de um tom atemporal e que simboliza calma parece necess√°ria. ‚ÄúN√£o sabemos para onde ir e em quem confiar.

Voc√™ d√° um trato no rosto antes de dormir? Dedique 2 minutos (sim, s√≥ isso) a esse cuidado. Lembre que durante o dia sua pele ficou impregnada de suor, polui√ß√£o, poeira e sebo do rosto. Essa gororoba entope poros, provoca cravos e espinhas e piora a acne em quem j√° tem esse problema. Ir para a cama com o rosto limpo e hidratado tamb√©m diminui a oleosidade e o brilho e previne rugas (a pele se regenera durante o sono). Lave o rosto com sabonete facial, passe hidratante ou creme (dependendo da sua idade) e bons sonhos!

""It's taken in the Javakheti region, Georgia, where the Doukhobors community [has lived] for approximately two centuries now after being exiled from Russia. Doukhobors are a Christian religious minority that believe that that god is in everyone and there is no need [for] priests or churches because every person can communicate to god without them. They are pacifists and hard-working people, who have always respected females and often had female community leaders. They had one of the richest communities throughout the whole soviet republic. But last 30 years have been very hard for them, and they started leaving the country. Most of them migrated to Russia and Canada. There is no opportunities and poverty for youth. Nowadays, there are very few of them left. That's what my project is all about--about the beauty, importance and problems of this community. That it will soon disappear.

More pics on my story üë©üèª"
Foram 3,5 BILH√ïES de visualiza√ß√µes apenas em 2019. Nem nos meus maiores sonhos eu poderia imaginar chegar nesse patamar, mas o q eu realmente jamais poderia sonhar era q um dia eu seria o segundo youtuber mais assistido do planeta, perdendo apenas pro meu maior √≠dolo: o PewDiePie. Atingir essa marca com v√≠deos em portugu√™s √© uma coisa sobrenatural e inacredit√°vel. E eu s√≥ posso agradecer a cada um de voc√™s, que continuam sempre do meu lado! Que venha 2020!!!
Paz √© isso ‚ù§Ô∏è (ignore meu joelho torto, ele tem problemas)
Ser premiado como ‚ÄúHomem do Ano‚Äù pela GQ foi bastante especial. Em 2019, decidi q lutaria para tentar dar voz aos que mais s√£o silenciados. Optei por tentar ao m√°ximo mostrar a luta e o trabalho daqueles que tanto merecem e normalmente ficam √† margem. E receber este pr√™mio das m√£os do Kond foi muito emocionante. O Kond √© a prova viva do que representa o funk pro POVO brasileiro, quer voc√™ goste ou n√£o, quer voc√™ escute ou n√£o. O que aconteceu em Parais√≥polis √© mais um exemplo do racismo estrutural vivido nesse pa√≠s, onde a persegui√ß√£o √© sempre ao preto e ao pobre. Quantas raves e festas da elite s√£o ignoradas pela PM? Quando foi que o Rock‚Äôn Rio teve batida policial contra o uso de drogas? Com esse pr√™mio em m√£os, eu refor√ßo a luta q tive em 2019 e que continuarei em 2020: o uso do meu privil√©gio de homem, h√©tero e branco para tentar dar voz aos que n√£o podem desfrutar da mesma posi√ß√£o social. Kond, muito obrigado por me entregar este pr√™mio, voc√™ √© um g√™nio e um vision√°rio. 2020 que nos aguarde! (Fotos: @fabiocordeirofoto / @carolinademper / @olivetti)

"Guardian Of The Earth

Semalem di @masjidrayakebayoranresidences, bareng temen-temen santri @barisan_bangunnegeri, kembali bahas #lesswaste, dengan tema Guardian Of The Earth

Karena kalau Guardian Of The Galaxy udah mainstream, kita bahasnya bumi aja, menjadi penjaga bumi, a.k.a Khalifah fil ardhi, kalau bahasa Al-Qur'annya

Intinya sih, kita seringkali nggak adil pada perintah Allah. Bahwa kita memandang bahwa ketaatan itu hanya masalah ibadah ritual, tapi menjaga lingkungan kita abaikan

Padahal menjaga lingkungan itu disebut sebagai tugasnya manusia, sama seperti memelihara kehidupan antar manusia. Artinya sama-sama bagian tugas dari Allah

Tapi soal kini, orang nggak shalat kita sedih, tapi kita nggak sedih ketika ada pengrusakan hutan. Orang pacaran kita nasihati, tapi yang buang sampah sembarang kita biarin

Ini nasihat kepada diri saya sendiri, bahwa menjaga alam itu sama seperti menjaga manusia. Sebaliknya juga, menjaga manusia itu juga pada akhirntya menjaga alam

Siapa yang hadir dan inget materi semalem? Saya harap nggak terlalu mumet yaa.. Dan masih bersambung kok, jadi akan ada bahasan selanjutnya, siap-siap deh

Buat yang nggak dateng, nanti bakal ada videonya di YouTube, jadi pantentin aja, semoga ada manfaatnya bagi yang nggak kesempatan hadir, tapi tetep mau mantau

Tetep semangat buat #LessWaste dari #MasjidPeradaban, bareng guru-guru kita di #BarisanBangunNegeri, @hanan_attaki @ustadzabdulsomad_official @oemar_mita @binanies @luqmanulhakimashabul @salimafillah @felixsiauw @adihidayatofficial"
"Pre-Order Komik Al-Fatih 1453 by @felixsiauw @myodauz

Alhamdulillah, nggak ada kata lebih tepat selain puji syukur pada Allah. Sebab buku ini dikerjain lebih dari 1 tahun lamanya, niatnya sih 6 bulan, kenyataannya dobel hehe

Seperti yang sudah temen-temen tau, saya barengan sama @alfatihstudios menganggap bahwa salah satu yang harus difokuskan itu membangun generasi muda

Karenanya dalam beberapa tahun terakhir ini, saya dan @alfatihstudios lebih banyak produksi bacaan dan referensi buat anak-anak, supaya orangtua punya pilihan

Beda dengan komik Al-Fatih 1453 yang dulu pernah saya garap. Buku @komikalfatih1453 ini saya garap bareng @myodauz sebagai ilustrator, supaya lebih child-ish

Jadi buku ini lebih menitikberatkan pada perkembangan mental Al-Fatih kecil, bagaimana keluarga dan ulama mendidik karakter ksatria pada Al-Fatih

Karena sebagai orangtua, tentu saya sangat memahami sulitnya ayah-bunda lain dalam memilih referensi terbaik buat anak-anaknya, yang fun dan islami tentunya

Dan insyaAllah dalam pekan depan sudah bisa dinikmati. Sekarang Pre-Order sudah dibuka, bisa ke link yang sudah disediakan di bawah ini atau WA ke no: +62 852-8309-9873

Buku Komik ""Al-Fatih 1453"" - Full Color
180 halaman - Rp. 79.000
Link Pre-Order: http://bit.ly/orderKomikAlfatih1453

Pre-Order hanya dibuka 3 hari di 03-05 Desember 2019, dan insyaAllah akan dikirim di tanggal 08 Desember, dan ditandatangani oleh penulis dan ilustratornya langsung, yuk buruan deh di-order komiknya

Dan @komikalfatih1453 ini direncanakan ada beberapa seri, doakan semoga @myodauz bersemangat, jadi seri ke-2 nggak usah nunggu tahun depan hahaha.. sip

"Lisan (Tulisan) Kita Pada Nabi Muhammad

Lisan hanyalah proyeksi dari pemikiran dan hati. Maka apa yang tampak dari lisan, seperti itulah kiranya isi pikir dan hati. Mungkin bisa direkayasa, tapi tak selamanya

Maka kita bisa tahu apa gambaran akal dan hati para penyair yang menggubah kisah Rasulullah dengan rangkaian bahasa yang penuh makna, seberapa cinta di dalamnya

Begitu pula dengan mereka yang lisannya penuh cela, penuh kata kasar, penuh hinaan, memaki dan merendahkan orang, maka pikiran dan hatinya pun sudah bisa ditera

Yang perlu kita tahu, bahwa apa yang dilisankan, atau di masa sosial media saat ini, yang dituliskan, itu tak bisa menyamai apa yang tersimpan dalam pikir dan hatinya

Berkaitan itu Allah tegaskan, ""Telah nyata kebencian dari mulut mereka, dan apa yang disembunyikan oleh hati mereka adalah lebih besar lagi"" dalam QS 3: 118

Seperti seorang penyair takkan bisa mewakili perasaan dalam akal dan hati dengan kata-katanya, begitu juga para pembenci takkan puas dengan caci maki dan cela mereka

Itulah mengapa, mereka yang memikirkan dan merasakan sesuatu secara terus-menerus, takkan bisa menahan itu selamanya. Tanya saja pada yang jatuh cinta

Mereka yang jatuh cinta selalu menemukan cara untuk bisa mengutarakan rasa. Bahkan tanpa suara, seperti cinta dalam diam, yang dihela dalam sujud dan doa

Ia akan ungkapkan pikir dan rasa dalam cara yang paling indah, kata-kata yang paling tepat, kalimat yang paling pas, serta kesempatan yang paling sempurna

Sampai pada kita, bagaimana cinta Imam Malik pada Nabi, membuatnya mandi, bersiwak, memakai baju indah dan parfum terbaik, bersurban, tiap membaca haditsnya

Tak hanya itu, Imam Malik akan naik ke mimbar, mewangikan ruangan dengan bukhur, menunggu hadirin tenang dan khusyu, baru membacakan sabda Nabi yang mulia

Sekarang kita pahami, mengapa kita mungkin sering tak sopan, atau berkata yang tak sepantasnya tentang Nabi, mungkin pikir dan rasa kita yang perlu diperiksa

After 17 years of working unfulfilling jobs, now I work for myself and get to spend so much more time with my family. I work with my wife and we get to eat lunch together every day and laugh and joke about silly things as we grow our business together.  And we have 3 healthy growing kids who provide us with endless entertainment (and challenges üòÄ). For all these things I feel thankful and priveledged to enjoy them. Happy Thanksgiving, friends!

"Photos by @FransLanting Today is Wildlife Conservation Day and I‚Äôd like to pay tribute to Jane Goodall who has done so much to open our eyes and minds to the world of animals and their needs. I am honored to join her for a series of events in the Netherlands meant to increase support for her work. Jane‚Äôs Roots and Shoots programs empower young people around the world to engage with environmental causes. She is nurturing a next generation of conservation champions. We desperately need a new wave of youthful energy to help break logjams of inaction when it comes to creating a better balance between people and planet. We hope that you and your families will join us. Go to the link in my Instagram profile for event details and ticket info. Follow us @FransLanting and @ChristineEckstrom for more images and stories about the natural world and the people working to ensure there is a future for all of us.

photo by @FransLanting Only the bravest surfers dare to ride the gigantic waves at Nazare in Portugal, but @Kalanilattanzi takes it further. He practices bodysurfing! Unlike other surfers who pick up speed behind by jet skis to catch a wave, he has to create his own momentum to surf down a huge barrel of wild water, using only his flippers and a tiny hand board‚Äîand he gets wiped out at the end of every ride, yet he is totally cheerful about the experience. Amazing to see him in action. In case you wonder, he covers his head in bright colored sunscreen so that he can be spotted better by his own security support and by other surfers. Follow us @FransLanting and @ChristineEckstrom for more wild rides around the world. @Kalanilattanzi @leodomingox #surfing #bodysurfing #wave #bigwave #Nazare
"Photos by @FransLanting and friends. I‚Äôm giving thanks to the talented photographers who joined us for workshops at our studio in Santa Cruz, California, this past year. I love teaching photography and I am always amazed by the images our workshop participants create.

We are hosting three new photography workshops in the first half of 2020, and I invite you to join us to unleash your own creativity and improve your technical skills.

"We were hoping for mercy after Jane Goodall‚Äôs passionate plea, but unfortunately harsh verdicts have been issued against eight Iranian cheetah conservationists. Our friends Morad and Niloufar were sentenced to 10 years in prison; Houman and Taher to 8 years and Amir and Sepideh to 6 years. It is not known yet what the outcome is for Sam and Abdolreza. The charges have not been made public yet either. Because of the recent unrest in Iran it is difficult to know what is going on. The internet was shut down for almost a week. It is unclear what we can do at the moment, but we are not giving up and we will keep you informed. Thanks to you all for your heartfelt comments. @NatGeo published an online story the other day that explains the political background for this tragedy.

"Photo by @FransLanting Baobabs glow against a night sky in western Madagascar. These ‚Äúupside-down trees‚Äù are associated with Africa, but while that entire continent has only one species, Madagascar is home to six species of baobabs, all of them unique to that wondrous island. Locally they‚Äôre called ‚ÄúReniala‚Äù, meaning mother of the forest. This image was included in my recent exhibition at Xposure 2019 in Sharjah, UAE.

Last week I was in The United Arab Emirates where His Highness Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, the Ruler of Sharjah and His Excellency Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, the Chairman of Sharjah‚Äôs Media Council, honored me by visiting my exhibition during the Xposure 2019 Opening Ceremony in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Go to the link in my profile if you want to see some of the images that were on display. In just a few years time Xposure has become one of the great international photography festivals thanks to the support of the Sharjah government. It was a fabulous event and I thank everyone involved for their hospitality and hard work. It was great to spend some time with my friends @amivitale @stephenwilkes there as well.

"Photo by @FransLanting Every iceberg tells a story. Each one is a snapshot of water frozen in time. I photographed this blue diamond along the Antarctic Peninsula in early summer knowing it would be gone in a few months. Ninety percent of all ice on Earth is contained by Antarctica, and as our planet warms, ice shelves and glaciers dislodge an ever-larger portion of it each year into the Southern Ocean, where most icebergs melt away in a single season‚Äîadding to sea level rise. That‚Äôs how the life cycle of ice far away affects everyone living along a sea coast anywhere. 
A global #ClimateStrike will take place tomorrow, Friday, September 20, in advance of the UN Climate Action Summit, demanding action to address the climate crisis we are facing. The September 20 strike will kick off a week of actions capped by another strike on September 27. We urge you to take a stand with us. Together, let‚Äôs show our politicians we are serious about the fight against climate change. Join us, @FransLanting and @ChristineEckstrom, in this effort, and check the link in my bio to find out about events in your community and how you can join the strike.

"Photo by @FransLanting The Eastern side of California‚Äôs Sierra Nevada mountains is a wonderland for photography with places like Yosemite, Mono Lake and the White Mountains within an hours drive if you start out at Mammoth Lakes‚Äì which is not a bad place in its own right. Here are two images from previous field trips in the area. The first one shows a hiker coming upon an ancient bristlecone pine. These trees are among the oldest living things on the planet. Some of them are known to be almost 5000 years old. The second shows a Photographer on an alpine lake shore in the Ansel Adams Wilderness. 
I am excited to go back there soon when I speak at the Mammoth Photo Fest in Mammoth Lakes, California October 10-13 along with my colleagues @cristinamittermeier, @pedromcbride, and @coreyrichproductions.

"Photo by @FransLanting A radio story by PRI‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe World‚Äù program about Iran‚Äôs jailed cheetah conservationists for which I was interviewed is airing today on NPR stations nationwide. Tune in to your local station or click on the link in my Instagram profile to hear it. Our friends have been in prison now for more than a year and a half. Their trials in Tehran are in a critical stage and It is important that they are not forgotten. They are patriots dedicated to saving one of Iran‚Äôs most powerful natural symbols from extinction and their arrest is a tragedy for them and their families as well as for the future survival of Iran‚Äôs cheetahs. Please, help spread word about this injustice.

"Photo by @FransLanting Two orphaned orangutans cling to each other at a rehab center in northern Borneo. Like humans, they need affection and care from their mothers in order to become healthy adults. Orangutans are the last great apes that survive outside of Africa. They live only on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, and they are endangered due to the massive destruction of their forest habitat. Baby orangs are also victims of the illegal pet trade‚Äîcaptured by poachers who kill their mothers to reach them. It is imperative that we protect the forests orangutans depend on to insure that our next of kin on the family tree of life will be with us beyond our own lifetime. I welcome you to support the organizations that are in the front lines of protecting them, such as the World Wildlife Fund and Wild Aid. I share this image in honor of World Orangutan Day. Follow me @FransLanting and @ChristineEckstrom for more images of endangered animals around the world.

"Last night was such an amazing¬†night!
I LOVE Coldplay, their music¬†has been with me in most of the meaningful crossroads in my life.
Last night I was invited to see their sound check before the amazing show at the Natural History Museum.
and for a moment it was just us, and them, under a giant 100-year-old skeleton of a blue whale.
All those incredible elements¬†-¬†¬†art, music, nature, people and time - came together and created the most magical night.
I was dancing, singing, flying and loving all the way back home.
Thank you¬†@coldplay for a night I will never forget. @jaronvarsano @ivesha @tammy_federman"

The past 10 days I haven‚Äôt been very active over here, and you might wonder why. I had a wisdom tooth extraction with surgery which developed into a dry socket. In an attempt to speed up the recovery, I was given an iodine aid but I developed a strong reaction to it. Turns out I‚Äôm extremely allergic to Iodine. My whole mouth broke down into painful ulcers, making me lose all taste and haven‚Äôt been able to properly eat for a while now. On top of that, due to suffering from very low blood pressure all my life [ this is a condition I‚Äôve been born with and makes me feel tired most of the time ] all strong painkillers are out of the question because they tend to make me feel worse than the actual pain itself giving me nauseas and making me sick. However, this whole thing haven‚Äôt stopped me from having work meetings and waking up at 5 am everyday to prepare the launch of @amlul drop 2 in a few days. And if I‚Äôm sharing this with you is not to make you feel pity for me, but to share how much I appreciate every minute I‚Äôve felt in good healthy and strong, now more than ever. We only have one body to love and we need to look after it more than we actually do ‚ù£Ô∏è .

"Love the absolute simplicity and warmth of this home. .

By #airesmateus via @yellowtrace #gdinteriorinspiration .
(Also - notice the wall to wall carpet! I love them in bedrooms and it‚Äôs my plan to put one in mine)"
"Most people will tell you this : if you let it, LA will make you quite a healthy person. You start eating better & going out in nature & to the gym. I exercise everyday and I don‚Äôt ever think about it. It‚Äôs part of my life. I run, I do yoga, Pilates. I love it, it‚Äôs not even an effort anymore (I can‚Äôt believe it myself)
.
But I‚Äôve always missed something more. I like the idea of being a student - not just aim to feel and look better - but making the practice an art.
.
It‚Äôs quite impossible today to find a yoga class where you can build up on your knowledge year after year, you know what I mean? Yoga has become automated in order to be accessible to most, teachers kind of come and go - even more in hot yoga which I practice & LOVE nonetheless.
.
Anyway. I‚Äôve always been attracted to martial arts - I had done Aikido a long time ago and loved everything from the philosophy to the sense of respect, perseverance and inner calm. I liked looking forward to a new belt. And also, I liked to feel like I could defend myself.
.
So I‚Äôd been looking for a club in LA for a while and honestly, they can feel a little intimidating. So when I met the wonderful @sophkupersmith 6 months ago and she told me that Jiu Jitsu had changed her life, I told her I wanted in. Thing is she lives in Newport. Took a while to make it happen - but yesterday I finally did.
.
I came early to watch a class, then had a private with the amazing @gustavofonseca_jj + @alexisfonseca_jj (there are a lot of champions there) where I learned to fall on my back & basically how to break someone‚Äôs shoulder. Important skills, no? All this of course in full Martial Art respectful, beautiful spirit. .

I LOVED it. .

Ok doesn‚Äôt hurt that the aesthetic of @artofjiujitsu is incredible and that Jj students come to the mat from every walks of life, making it a place where you get out of your social bubble. Which I need so much. .
Okay, enough talking, I am going to put more photos in my stories.
.
And I now I am looking for a club in West LA if any of you know any. .

Thank you @sophkupersmith for opening the doors and thank you @artofjiujitsu + the students for letting me take photos üôèüèº thank you @timothylayaban !!!
."
We have added new art prints to our collection, some of my new illustrations, new posters, all along with our beautiful collaboration with @marniegilder and I am so excited about what‚Äôs to come for our artist‚Äôs collaborations. SO EXCITED! If you want to see what I am talking about, follow the link in bio!!! @dore

"I am so happy and proud to announce the launch of our artist‚Äôs residencies - for years I have wanted to create and support the creative community around me, so the launch of these new posters is a big moment!
.
We start with @marniegilder , whose work you might remember because it is on the walls at my house. She is an artist from Australia and created three prints for us.
.
In the future we‚Äôll have more amazing artists, painters, photographers and soon, exhibitions!
.
In the meantime, the posters, which are beautifully printed, are available at @dore on our store. Link in bio to see (and buy!!!) all of them!

"Hi!!! Yeah! From bed. .
.
Em and I found the secret to life when it comes to flying towards Europe and it‚Äôs the bloody day flight!!! .

You know how usually you leave in the evening after a full day and then you get traffic on the way to the airport and then you spend a weird 4h night sleeping amongst snoring strangers and then you hit the morning traffic on the way to town and then you try to take a shower and pretend like you‚Äôre alive for the rest of the day, which you‚Äôre not, let‚Äôs be honest you‚Äôre total return of the walking dead üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and then no matter how much melatonin and caffeine you pump in your system it takes you a week to adjust and recuperate?
.
I know, probably one of the worst of the first world problems.
.
Well we solved it. .

For some reason we booked a day flight, knowing very well we would lose an entire day (we left at 8am and arrived at 8pm) and that I‚Äôd tell myself I‚Äôd work but would end up watching Animal Kingdom - Em pretended the WiFi wasn‚Äôt working in order to justify her laziness which totally wasn‚Äôt true since I was using it but hey we all find our own excuses (I didn‚Äôt have one, I‚Äôm just lazy and I wanna what shady stuff Smurf will do next).
.
Anyway so we booked a day flight, did absolutely nothing the whole time, and arrived in London, no traffic, straight into our beds for a long night, and since then, we‚Äôve been on fire.
.
No return of the walking dead for us. No jet lag, just a tiny yawn around 3pm.
.
Anyway I thought it was a very important health message üòÇ - I stopped doing the awful LA - NYC red eye a while back (this one is the worstest) but now I know my plan for Europe.
.
.
.
Sleep + rest = mental health, and mental health is everything. 
And I joke about it, but I‚Äôm actually super serious about it. So that‚Äôs it! Let‚Äôs go to bed. Let‚Äôs lose a day when necessary, so we can live the ones after, fully."
On the way to London, a softer moment to breathe, dream, get lost above the clouds.
"Thank you @harvard @harvardlaw for having me!
.
Thank you to Reina and all the lovely students. .

It‚Äôs nice to come and be a ‚Äúteacher‚Äù but it was funny to realize that even though there is probably no more glorious place to study than an Ivy League school, I would never go back to these years. Oh how I hated being a student!!! I couldn‚Äôt see it at the time because that was all I knew - and I was terrified I had no life skills. There was probably some good sides to it and a few great teachers.
.

But - big sense of dread when I reminisce about it. 
I think the best day of my student life was the one where I decided to stop my studies. 
And most of what I do today I learned outside of school.
.
Not telling you to quit school ü§ì just that we all have different learning styles, and that maybe I would have been kinder to myself had I known that before.
.
Did you love studying? Would you go back? Like, if I told you you were admitted at Harvard?"
"For so many years I tried to think my way through life. Take the right course of action, plan, own my mistakes, try again. .

I also tried to control my way through my healing. I tried to understand why I was who I was and how I could be a better person. My mom, my dad, my childhood, bla, bla.
.
I tried to do what‚Äôs right in every aspect of my life. .

Until recently, life threw me a few curveballs. Some good, some bad, but the floor under my feet suddenly didn‚Äôt feel that stable anymore.
.
And maybe it‚Äôs because of all the work that I did on myself - so, I am not discarding it - or maybe it‚Äôs maturity, or maybe we just change, but all of a sudden I didn‚Äôt want to think it through.
.
Instead just let go and and accept and adapt and trust. Do what I feel, instead of what I think is ‚Äúthe right thing to do‚Äù.
.
It‚Äôs been good. 
And profound - and I know it‚Äôs just the start.
It‚Äôs like I used to be at war with life and suddenly put my weapons gently on the floor and realized it was okay to just be me. .

It‚Äôs not easy because my old ways are endlessly trying to make a come back. I‚Äôd be the type of person to overthink on how to not overthink.
.
.
.
There is so much there that can‚Äôt be covered in only a few words but I wanted to write this because I feel like with the wellness trend something is happening where we get caught up in our ‚Äúhealing‚Äù like it‚Äôs a job. I hear people telling me : ‚ÄúI am working on my mother wound‚Äù or ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm good, I‚Äôm fixed! 15 years of therapy!‚Äù. I recently went to a sort of ayahuasca gathering (I personally haven‚Äôt tried, I‚Äôm not against it) and it literally felt like a competition of who was the most woke and healed, and because I hadn‚Äôt done it, pffff, I couldn‚Äôt know. Maybe that‚Äôs true. Or maybe humans are humans and they need to compete even in spirituality. .

But what I truly think is, relax, no one is ever fixed. It‚Äôs time to chill. We‚Äôre all pretty much messes underneath. And it‚Äôs really  okay.
.
.
.
Recently I have also really loved pristine skies like this one. Not the sunset, but right after - when the tension of the day is gone, and the colors peacefully fill the sky in all its spaciousness. That moment, the let go."
"This week and the next one are going to be fun. I‚Äôll be speaking with @nililotan , then go up to Boston to give a talk at @harvard , then host an event with @lamer and @nordstrom , then do a keynote at @bof Voices and host another event in London I‚Äôll tell you about soon*. .

I love this type of work because it‚Äôs all about connecting with others and telling stories. .

I was thinking of the outfits I‚Äôll pack, and the only thing I can think about is good jeans and tee-shirts. Or sweater because it‚Äôs getting cold apparently on the other side of the planet. Awesome shoes. Simple. Because when I look back, that‚Äôs always how I feel the most myself and when you‚Äôre doing public speaking, all you want to feel is ease and confidence.
.
I started wondering what I could get away with, and I still haven‚Äôt really answered the question. Maybe I‚Äôll change my mind and freak out at the last minute and go on a shopping hunt and it could be fun, stressful and pricey. Or maybe I‚Äôll just trust myself, do me, and see how it works.
.
.
.
And yes @imranamed I promise I‚Äôll bring a dress for the gala! I‚Äôm not a savage! (Yet üòú)

Freshly ground black pepper‚†Ä
‚†Ä
‚†Ä
METHOD‚†Ä
‚†Ä
--Roasted Sesame Salt--‚†Ä
Place a frying pan on medium heat, add the sesame seeds (no oil needed) and fry until golden.‚†Ä
Remove the sesame seeds from the pan and place into a bowl.‚†Ä
To the same bowl, add the sea salt, aleppo pepper or chili flakes, and a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper, stir to combine.‚†Ä
Set the mixture aside.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
--Baked Chips--‚†Ä
Slice the white potatoes into 6-9 pieces.‚†Ä
Slice the sweet potato into roughly 12 pieces.‚†Ä
Steam the combined potato slices for 20 minutes.‚†Ä
Set the steamed potatoes aside to cool.‚†Ä
Preheat your oven to 180C/350F (fan-forced oven).‚†Ä
Coat the potatoes with a little olive oil and place onto 1-2 baking trays.‚†Ä
Ensure the potatoes are well spaced so they have room to crisp up in the oven.‚†Ä
Sprinkle with a little sea salt. ‚†Ä
Bake the chips for 60 minutes, turning them halfway through baking time. ‚†Ä
Once crispy and golden brown, remove from the oven, sprinkle with roasted sesame salt, and serve with the mayonnaise.‚†Ä
NOTE: Store the leftover roasted sesame salt in an airtight jar or container in the fridge.‚†Ä

Main ferry terminal of the Buriganga River, Bangladesh, 2017.  With a rapidly growing population and decaying infrastructure, the river remains the one of the most important modes of transportation for Dhaka.  As an American, it was a suggestion of what it could have been like to see the human spectacle of New Orleans, St. Louis, or New York from the air in the mid 19th Century.
Terraced rice fields just south of the Red River, Yunnan, China.  These terraces are 2,500 years old, and are worked with the help of water buffalo.  The Chinese name for this area is Ti Tian or "ladder to heaven". The vertical relief of some terraces exceeds 2,000 ft. making them the biggest contiguous section of rice terraces in the world.
Twisted folds of wind eroded rocks and sand dunes fill the Chaidamu Basin in Quinghai, China.  Sometimes people ask me what‚Äôs so interesting about deserts, like, they‚Äôre just wastelands.  To me the deserts are the last great class of wilderness left on this planet. #DesertAirBook #paramotor
Philae Temple was built on an island near the first cataract on the Nile during the Ptolemaic period.  After construction of the first Aswan dam, it was seasonally flooded, before being relocated by @UNESCO to this higher site on an adjacent islet.  In ancient times it was a site for religion as well as commerce, as trade goods had to be off-loaded here to pass the rapids.

Low tide on the most seaward island in the flood-prone delta of the Brahmaputra/Jamuna River in Bangladesh.  The rice crop here is just inches above the high tide line, and even the smallest storm surge causes significant damage. Sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal have been increasing significantly, leading to stronger monsoon flooding. Scientists say Bangladesh has suffered some of the fastest sea-level rises in the world, and project at least a five-foot rise by 2100, displacing 50 million people.

"At 1:23 am on April 26, 1986, Reactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant blew up. The radioactive fallout spread over thousands of square kilometers, driving more than a quarter of a million people permanently from their homes. More than 100,000 people may have succumbed to Chernobyl-related illnesses. It remains the worst nuclear accident to date.

While the accident itself created chaos of apocalyptic magnitude, more than three decades later, tourists and guides are creating another bewildering disturbance even as they (naively) seek to articulate a deeper comprehension. Today, the most riveting attraction, the ghost town of Pripyat, bears less-than-honest witness to the disaster, as tourists hastily rearrange items‚Äîabandoned dolls, gas masks, furniture and more‚Äîin an attempt to form a haunting scene for the next tour group, or just to photograph themselves.

"Inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ludmila is overcome by memories as she silently pauses on the edge of the bed in a small room where she used to rest between shifts while working in Pripyat‚Äôs Polissya Hotel.

Ludmila was one of the quarter million people who were evacuated and relocated in 1986 after the world‚Äôs worst nuclear disaster to date. Former residents of Pripyat are only allowed to revisit the Zone once each year‚Äîin the spring on Parents‚Äô Day. As an alternative, residents can return as tourists, since tourism was legalized in the Zone in 2011.  Due to the attention received by the incredible HBO miniseries, ‚ÄúChernobyl,‚Äù there has been renewed interest in my project and book, ‚ÄúThe Long Shadow of Chernobyl.‚Äù The recent exhibit of my Chernobyl images in Saint Petersburg, Russia, received remarkable coverage in the Russian media (including six television reports). @thephotosociety #Chernobyl #ExclusionZone #Pripyat #Ukraine #TheLongShadowofChernobyl"
"Tourists are questionably playful as they pose for a photograph near the historic Bernauer Strasse site at the Berlin Wall Memorial. When the Berlin Wall was erected, this area became famous for window escapes from apartment blocks lining the streets. Several people died here when the Wall was first enforced. 
The Berlin Wall Memorial is the central memorial site of German division, located in the middle of the capital. The memorial contains the last piece of Berlin Wall with the preserved grounds behind it and is thus able to convey an impression of how the border fortifications developed until the end of the 1980s. The events that took place here, together with the preserved historical remnants and traces of border obstacles on display help to make the history of Germany's division comprehensible to visitors, although some tourists may not fully grasp the tragedy that took place.
Today, November 9th marks the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the barrier that separated East and West Berlin from 1961 to 1989. The wall completely encircled West Berlin, and a ‚Äúdeath strip‚Äù was added on the East German side in the years following initial construction. Officially, 138 people died trying to escape from East to West.

"Photo by @williamalbertallard // IL Buckaroo Ricky Morris Wrangling Horses - Nevada, 1979. 
As part of his bi-annual flash sale, my dear friend and @natgeo colleague, @williamalbertallard (Bill Allard) is offering this signed print for $100 for a three week period beginning November 4th and ending on November 25th at 11:59 pm (EST). This flash sale print is a 6‚Äù x 9‚Äù image on a 9‚Äù x 11‚Äù paper. It is an archival ink jet print on archival watercolor paper.  It is signed IDed in graphite pencil on the front border. Link in Bill‚Äôs bio to purchase. 
Here is what Bill writes about the image: 
Every morning and late afternoon, each buckaroo on the IL cow crew picked one of the five or six horses in their group to ride.  Ricky Morris was one of the buckaroos at the IL Ranch, in Nevada.  The working cowboy has never made much money but he has had a certain independence.  The skills, like wrangling, don‚Äôt come with the hat. They have to be acquired and learned. 
I took this shot in early morning light.  The dust acts as kind of a scrim over the picture. But the key to the image is the rope. The line of that rope cutting the diagonal at the back of Ricky‚Äôs hand, then the sharp vertical descending to the coil of ropes, which is just off-center of the picture ‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs the handle for the photograph. Right there. 
@thephotosociety #BillAllard"
"While going through my archives, I came across this image from the early 1990s, showing a Ukrainian coal miner scrubbing down after a day in the pits. Though they were relatively well paid, miners faced equipment breakdowns and gas explosions as they extracted Ukraine‚Äôs high-grade coal. According to estimates at that time, every million tons of coal cost the life of one miner. After spending a day with the miners in such a harsh and challenging environment, I brought my camera along and continued photographing, even as we cleaned ourselves up.

"The nuclear accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, contaminated thousands of square miles, forcing 150 thousand inhabitants to hastily abandon their homes. Posters of disgraced Politburo members, most likely preparations for upcoming May Day celebrations, litter the floor of an abandoned storage facility in Pripyat, once the largest town in the area with 49 thousand inhabitants. Decades later, the Politburo posters remain a haunting reminder of a tragedy worsened by the initial denial of the Soviet political class. 
My exhibit, ‚ÄúThe Long Shadow of Chernobyl,‚Äù at the ROSPHOTO State Photo Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia, will be closing September 22. 
The amazing HBO miniseries, ‚ÄúChernobyl‚Äù has been widely viewed in Russia. Due to its success, some in the Russian media announced they would follow up with their own version of the story, in which the CIA is portrayed as one of the culprits of the disaster. Even Russians, however, were making fun of this take. The trailer, which had already premiered on YouTube, has now disappeared.

"Scientists monitor the radiation along the remnants of the Red Forest, one of the most contaminated areas after the explosion of the Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor No.4. The forest‚Äôs name comes from the ginger color of the trees after they died, having absorbed high levels of radiation after the accident. Much of the Red Forest burnt and was buried in ‚Äúwaste graveyards.‚Äù The photograph, which was taken in 1993, is part of my current exhibit ‚ÄúThe Long Shadow of Chernobyl‚Äù at the ROSPHOTO State Photo Museum in St. Petersburg, where 100 of my images chronicling the aftermath of the disaster are on display until September 27. I just returned from the opening and was overwhelmed by the magnitude of coverage it received from the Russian media‚Äîfrom online articles to many television, radio and newspaper interviews.

"Inside the belly of the beast. In my time documenting the aftermath of Chernobyl, I have gone further into the destroyed Reactor No. 4 than any other Western still photographer, each time for only 15-30 minutes. This spot, however, was so contaminated that, despite wearing protective gear, I only had about one minute to shoot. 
This weekend, I am heading off to the opening of my exhibit, ‚ÄúThe Long Shadow of Chernobyl‚Äù at the ROSPHOTO state photo museum in Saint Petersburg, which will show over 100 of my photographs from the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. The opening coincides with much renewed interest in the accident after the Chernobyl miniseries on HBO, which was noticed in Russia as well. 
The opening of the exhibit will be on Tuesday, August 6 at 6pm at the ROSPHOTO state photo museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

"In the 15th and 16th centuries, the silver mines of Schwaz in Tirol, Austria were considered to be the largest in the world. Today, visitors to the mines can watch how strenuous the process used to be.  The miner in the foreground of the image is real and pictured next to a statue of a miner in the background. 
This image, shot a few years ago, was part of a story on the Fuggers‚Äîthe German equivalent of the Medici in Italy, a prosperous merchant family situated in Augsburg, a town in Southern Germany and a commercial center of its time. The silver mines were one of the main sources of the Fugger‚Äôs wealth. Their name stands not only for wealth and clever business management, but also for a far-reaching influence on the political events of that time which shaped the fates of both Germany and Europe.

I have learned how to be content with whatever I have. I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little.

In love com meu piercing üòúüñ§"
Hj eu to assim...soh na pregui√ßa üò¥üåπ
Nos √∫ltimos dias fiquei me perguntando o porqu√™ de certas coisas. Perdi um grande amigo de inf√¢ncia e junto a isso outras tantas not√≠cias tristes que me atravessaram. Coisas que pareciam erradas e injustas. Fiquei com o cora√ß√£o apertado e com muita vontade de chorar. Me tranquei no quarto do hotel onde que estava hospedada e orei. Eu precisava ter um momento meu com Deus. Precisava conversar com Ele sobre tudo que eu estava sentindo. Abrir o peito e entender o porqu√™ de tanta ang√∫stia, tanto sofrimento, tanto medo. Como acolher aqueles que me rodeiam e sentem o mesmo? Como acalmar o cora√ß√£o de algu√©m que sofre com a aus√™ncia de quem partiu? Como curar essa dor? Claro que n√£o tenho essas respostas, mas ter esse momento com Deus pacificou a minha alma e revelou o √≥bvio: tudo tem um porqu√™ para Ele, tudo √© perfeito no tempo d‚ÄôEle e nossa finitude ainda n√£o √© capaz de compreender seus mist√©rios. Mesmo que algumas perdas pare√ßam injustas, um dia saberemos o motivo, pois nada est√° no nosso controle. Tudo √© no tempo d‚ÄôEle, no tempo de DEUS. Em tempos dif√≠ceis como os que estamos vivendo √© preciso ter muita f√©, acreditar, acalmar o cora√ß√£o e seguir... Sempre buscando o nosso melhor, olhando para o pr√≥ximo, ouvindo quem precisa ser ouvido. Voc√™ pode achar que n√£o, mas muita gente se inspira em voc√™ e conta com voc√™. Muitos dependem de uma palavra, de um olhar ou um gesto pra seguir! Aproveite a vida e espalhe o bem. Seja luz. Sempre! üíóüôèüèøüôèüèøüôèüèø

"Every day, whether we realize it or not, we tell ourselves stories that can empower or discourage us. 
If something did not work out for you, you can either tell yourself a story that you‚Äôre not good enough, that you are screwed and nothing ever works or you can think that something better is on the way and you‚Äôre strong, capable and up to the challenge to learn and grow. 
Be your biggest supporter, tell yourself stories that help you become the person you want to be.

Todos os dias, muitas vezes sem perceber, contamos a n√≥s mesmos diferentes hist√≥rias que podem nos impulsionar ou desencorajar.

Seja o seu maior incentivador, conte hist√≥rias que o ajudem a se tornar a pessoa que voc√™ deseja ser.

"Friday night dinner üëÜüèª I answered a few questions on my insta story last night about my favorite fika spots, plans for the future, if our kids drive me crazy and what my favorite weeknight meals are. I have a ton more questions that I haven‚Äôt had time to answer yet so will try to do so asap. Check out my insta story if you are curious, and continue to ask here if there are any more things you want to know.
...
Roasted Veg Tray dinners are my fav weeknight meal. We make it with halves potatoes, lots of vegetables, garlic, lemon, crumbled halloumi and drizzle a little balsamico before serving. But it‚Äôs pretty good on weekends as well üòâüëåüèª"
"I have two important lessons to share with you all today:
Number 1. Always boil more potatoes than you need. Leftover potatoes make THE BEST sandwiches. Simply add a few dollops creamy spread (sour cream, cr√®me fraiche or vegan version), diced potato, finely chopped red onion, capers, thinly sliced cucumber, dill, salt and a good grind of black pepper to a crisp bread. Maybe lentils too if you have some at home. Ultra good!
üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
Number 2. Don‚Äôt google two-headed snakes. I‚Äòve spent 30 mins watching real two-headed snake videos on YouTube after seeing a photo on @natgeo and it didn‚Äôt do any good for my ophidiophobia. Ultra bad. üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª"
"Here are five good stews that will keep you warm through the winter. You can find the recipe by searching the recipe archive on our site (link in bio) but I‚Äôll also add direct links to the recipes in my insta story.
1. Beet Bourguignon - a GKS classic üëåüèª
2. Moroccan Aubergine Tagine with millet - my favorite
3. One-Pot Butternut Squash and Rice Stew - easy and comforting
4. Vegetarian Bouillabaisse with saffron - when you have friends over
5. Yoga Pot üßòüèª
Have you tried any of these already - which is your favorite?"
"Never met a waffle I didn‚Äôt like. Especially when topped with dollops of whipped cream, raspberry compote, lemon zest and a drizzle of date syrup.
I saw a similar waffle plate on @siribarje‚Äôs feed and apparently couldn‚Äôt get it off my mind until I made it myself. So this was lunch/dessert today and I ain‚Äôt sorry about it. And neither were the kids.
Some of you asked for a recipe for the batter so I‚Äôve jotted it down as I remembered it.
...
1 egg
1 cup rice flour + 2 tbsp potato starch
1/2 cup oat milk + 1/2 cup sparkling water
70 g melted butter or coconut oil
1 tsp baking powder
a pinch of salt"
If you haven‚Äôt tried Swedish Saffron Buns, you haven‚Äôt truly experienced Christmas üòâ I have never really understood why saffron is used as a Christmas spice in Sweden (and basically nowhere else) so if anyone knows, please let me know in the comments. What I do know is that the scent of these buns on advent morning gives me ALL the Christmas vibes. We created this vegan version of traditional saffron buns ages ago along with our first ever video (back when Elsa was just an √ºber cute toddler ü•∞). I might post the video on my IGTV if I can locate the original file. Meanwhile, you can get the recipe for the buns and watch the video through the link in my bio!

"Every year around runny-nose-season we make turmeric and ginger spiked honey. It takes maybe 4 minutes and the health properties of these ingredients aren‚Äôt even the most important thing to me - it just tastes so damn good. Sweet and sinus-clearingly fresh. Like a delicious little turmeric and ginger bomb hitting your body.
You make it with a small jar of honey, 2-3 tbsp freshly grated ginger (not dried), 2 tsp turmeric (freshly grated or dried), lemon zest and black pepper. Can be stored at room temp for a few weeks. Use in tea, on yogurt, porridge or eat it by the spoonful. It‚Äôs that good! üèÖüçØ"
"Hands up if you like Caponata ü§öüèªü§öüèªü§öüèªü§öüèªü§öüèª It‚Äôs a classic Sicilian side dish that bursts of flavor. It‚Äôs all made in one pan and tastes epic piled onto a piece of bread.
You make it by cooking cubed aubergine/eggplant, bell pepper, dried oregano and chili flakes in an oiled pan with onion and garlic. After a few minutes you add apple cider vinegar, olives, capers and some fresh tomatoes and let it cook for 20 minutes or until the aubergine is very soft and tender. And then you finish by stirring in a good handful fresh mint üëåüèª a little parsley and some extra olive oil.
It‚Äôs a killer dish and tastes great with pasta as well. Although the kids refuse to eat it because they think üçÜ is the üëø. You can find the full recipe in Green Kitchen Travels but you don‚Äôt really need a recipe for this as you can adapt the amounts pretty much to your liking."
"You know the temporary tattoos that we created to give vegetables a better rep among kids (and adults)? Well we FINALLY opened up a little web shop on our site and they are now available to order worldwide until Christmas! We thought they could be a sweet gift to put in a xmas stocking.
We worked together with one of our favorite artists @penelope_dullaghan on these and they turned out so epic, are easy to attach and look great on the skin. My favorite is the Veggie Monster, Luise loves the lemon and the kids pick the smoothie, broccoli and carrot. Which is your favorite?

"Wandering in Aalborg üß°üíõüíöüíôüíú
The historic center of Aalborg is a marvel to be discovered, with old houses, even 17th century, with classic Danish architecture, colorful facades and sloping roofs.
Some of these streets are populated by small art galleries and lead into artistic gardens with a welcoming atmosphere. Don‚Äôt desist from exploring them, it‚Äôs worth losing yourself in these streets and letting time go by, with the sun the colors are turned on and they lend themselves to suggestive pics, like this.

"Sometimes God allows us to walk through things to strengthen and refine us. Stay faithful.
‚Äî
Just a quick thought here: It‚Äôs our tendency to want to fix things in our lives before issues/situations occur (I know it‚Äôs mine as a husband for sure and who wouldn‚Äôt want to?). But maybe sometimes we aren‚Äôt meant to fix them, because a lot of the times (too often than we‚Äôd like), we can‚Äôt. Maybe in these times we are meant to walk through it, be stretched, be uncomfortable, but yet, grow from it. Maybe the Lord is teaching us through them and making sure we rely on and trust Him. Just maybe. Or He definitely is. Thoughts? Feedback? -Mark #goodnewsfeed"
I‚Äôm extremely proud to call @hypesir my friend! Thanks for being an example of Christ‚Äôs love to everyone. (Swipe for last part of video).
I thank and praise Him for all He does for me but I‚Äôll praise Him regardless because He‚Äôs my creator.
Happy Sunday everyone! Praise God well today!
Tonight‚Äôs prayer.
"üôåüí™ From @hertrueworth
„Éª„Éª„Éª
Because in our weakness, HE is made strong. The key is surrender.

If you are feeling overwhelmed like your back might buckle, it could be because you are trying to carry the weight all on your own.

The good news? You don‚Äôt have to carry the weight alone.

Yes, He can carry this burden. Yes, He can take the load off. However, He won‚Äôt grab it from you. You have to let it go from your grip and hand it to Him. Trust Him and depend on Him. He is worthy of your trust. Has He failed you yet?
.
‚ÄúCome to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.""‚Äù Matthew‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠11:28-30‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨
.
ü§çfor the woman who is feeling heavy and burdened, pray this prayer with meü§çüôèüèΩ
.
Heavenly Father,

Oh God, my heart is heavy right now, but I trust You with it. I do not have a lot to offer right now, but Lord I give You my whole heart, and I no longer want to lean on my own knowledge and understanding because this is what has caused me to feel burdened. I know that in all things You work for the good of those who love You, who have been called according to Your purpose. I give all praise and thanks to You, Father. For You are the One who makes me strong. I surrender every burden and weight to Your careful hands.

In Jesus‚Äô name, amen."
I know this is counterproductive for our Instagram ministry but trust me, it‚Äôs good for your soul. #goodnewsfeed #instagram #realworld #socialmedia

Comic Con 2019 was awesome. And this happened. Right now it feels like the only one worth posting. I demanded to work with Lin someday FYI. The coolest human.
Just landed in San Diego for comic con and these two dudes scared the crap out of me. They were waiting in the jet bridge when I got off the plane and asked if they could talk for a sec. But they just wanted a picture and offered to escort me through the airport. Thanks Dennis and Mitchell. Made my day. @portsdhpd
Well, I felt cool about my picture for a couple of days before LA showed me this. I can act like an athlete. She actually is one.
I was on the dock and spotting a very tired drowning duckling that had been separated from her mama and siblings :( I waited to see if her family would return but they never came back. I swam out to where she was struggling and she let me pick her up so easily because of how tired she was :‚Äô( I dried her off, kept her warm, and brought her home where we waited for wildlife rescue to come pick her up. She was safely transported to a home where many other lost little ducklings now live together :) I also named her Tulip üå∑ üê•

Hoy sentada en este balc√≥n junto a mi compa√±ero de vida les quiero compartir qu√© pienso en mi pa√≠s m√°s de lo que ustedes se imaginan y no solo en mi pa√≠s si no en todo lo que pasa a nuestro alrededor porque me duele mi gente, me duelen todas esas personas que quieren hacer las cosas bien. Casi nunca salgo pero hoy salimos a comprar unas cosas en la droguer√≠a y desde que sal√≠ me encontr√© con personas maravillosas. Al lado de la droguer√≠a conocimos a 3 hermosas mujeres, con almas bell√≠simas e incre√≠bles representantes de nuestro pa√≠s... as√≠ como esa gente bella que nos representa, barracas, educadas, nobles y echadas pa‚Äôl√°nte como decimos ac√°. As√≠ como ellas nos cruzamos much√≠simas personas y eso me hizo regresar a casa pensando m√°s en mi pa√≠s, en esos pocos que da√±an, que restan. Antes quiz√°s ten√≠a menos edad y no entend√≠a mucho muchas cosas pero ahora que quiz√°s mis prioridades han cambiado y mis sue√±os se ven acompa√±ados de una gran familia pues pienso en los que ser√°n mis hijos y me preocupa lo que ser√° el futuro para ellos y lo que es el presente para las nuevas generaciones que son las que quieren construir el cambio. Tengo muchas cosas en la cabeza pido excusas si no s√© usar muy bien los signos de puntuaci√≥n pero solo estoy escribiendo lo que voy pensando y de pensar y pensar y hablar y hablar concluyo algo que se dice mucho pero que es la verdad ‚Äúsomos m√°s los buenos‚Äù, ‚Äúla uni√≥n hace la fuerza‚Äù y as√≠ es. No lo llamemos guerra porque me parece una palabra agresiva... mmmmm digamos que estamos trabajando por el cambio y los cambios por lo general cuestan as√≠ que sigamos trabajando duro.

HairBesties, Find out what happens when your client tell you their hair is virgin and natural and you find out they have Henna in their hair. It was a Paranormal Hairtivity on my latest episode on Guys World on my YouTube Channel. Link is on my bio.
üíú I am excited to go back on The GuyTangWorldTour 2020. Where should I go do a show? I can‚Äôt wait to see all HairBestiesüíú
Which one do you like more? Left or Right? This is the Silver Smoke in @guytang_mydentity color are the best Silvers you‚Äôll find to create multi-level smoke tones and I love mixing them with other shades to create variations of smoky tones like the WickedShadows, TheNaked series, Dusty Lavender or even the Ni series mixes well with Silver Smoke. Treated both with @olaplex
Crimson Spell Red in SuperPower @guytang_mydentity is sooooo pigmented y‚Äôall.
Midnight Rose in @guytang_mydentity color is the perfect tone for this Holiday season.‚ù§Ô∏è
I made this chart to show you how I handle dark hair while basing the color with precision and why the extra steps insures a seamless blend. I show here how to use the new Shadow Ash series in @guytang_mydentity to lighten the base of a level 1 so the blonde highlights blend more without looking skunky black and blonde. Lifting the base gives a harmonious blend but also using the ShadowAsh makes sure the base isn‚Äôt brassy but cool.
"This is one of my favorite formulas using the Xpress toners in @guytang_mydentity 
I want to share it with you guys because it‚Äôs so beautiful that I want you guys to try it too. Mixing Pearl and Blush equal parts makes such a beautiful Iridescent Mauve Pearl tone. Always use the dedicated 6vol developer and mix 1:2 ratio to insure perfect deposit and gloss. üòçü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è"

@carv.ski is a digital ski coach that slips under your inner ski boot as an insole feeding real time coaching into you ears. It is designed for people who are already able to ski in order to improve and have more fun however we thought we‚Äôd try something new!

When I found out that it was down this morning, I got so excited to spend the day NOT looking at my phone, and bonus, not having the people I‚Äôm spending time with looking at their phones either.
It was bliss, while it lasted.
I didn‚Äôt know it was back until I just went to the store, and as I was waiting in line, the people ahead of me, faces buried in their phones, were oblivious to the cashiers saying ‚Äúnext customer please‚Äù.
I thought to myself, ‚ÄúInstagram must be back.‚Äù
Then I stood on my tiptoes to see the screens of those ahead of me, and sure enough... all scrolling on Instagram.
Oh well, it was good while it lasted.
This has got me thinking: Why not go ahead and pretend it‚Äôs still down, and enjoy this holiday as much as I used to enjoy holidays before social media was a thing.

I am actively retraining the crappy voice in my head, and I‚Äôm starting to feel the positive impact of this work throughout my day... and THAT makes me want to be even more diligent in this practice.

Photo by Robin Hammond @hammond_Robin. 92 year old Ivy Heath has vascular dementia. Sarah, a Senior Support Worker at Belong Limited (a charitable organization specializing in supporting people with dementia in north west England) told me about her: ‚ÄúShe has memory loss, she does get confused sometimes, she does get angry sometimes, she does get sad, upset. She‚Äôs a worrier, she worries, and wants to make sure everyone else is happy.‚Äù Sarah was clearly fond of Ivy. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so cute, so loving, she‚Äôs adorable. She‚Äôs just sweet. She‚Äôs just like your grandma. You‚Äôd love her like you‚Äôd love your grandma." You can see more stories from this series by following @onedayinmyworld
Photo by Robin Hammond @hammond_Robin. 76 year-old Tom didn‚Äôt speak much in our interview. Going through the transcript now I see myself asking: ‚ÄúWhat about growing older Tom? What are your thoughts on that?‚Äù Tom replies, ‚ÄúHopefully, yes.‚Äù I think he was being funny, but his sense of humour was so dry it was hard to tell. I asked him what his hopes for the future were. He says: ‚Äúeveryone hopes for the future just have to hope that it carries on.‚Äù Tom reminds me of my own father. Unlike Tom, my father doesn‚Äôt have dementia, but at 80, everything‚Äôs slowing down. But like my dad, Tom seems to just take it as it comes. He doesn‚Äôt dwell on getting older or the difficulties that have come with it. I, on the other hand, at nearly half their age, worry all the time about much smaller things... A lot of us, when we‚Äôre young, don‚Äôt place a lot of value in seniors. This work I‚Äôve been doing on dementia has helped me to understand the wisdom of age and the arrogance of youth. I wish I understood that earlier in my life. Let the seniors in your life know they‚Äôre valued, before they‚Äôre gone. You can see more stories from this series by following @onedayinmyworld
Photo by Robin Hammond @hammond_Robin ‚ÄúYes, I was diagnosed with that,‚Äù says 86 year-old Mary Griffiths when I asked her about dementia. But she wasn‚Äôt convinced: ‚ÄúSomebody said I was forgetting things - I don‚Äôt feel any different! I can remember quite well‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt gone quite crackers yet!‚Äù She lives in a care home specialising in supporting people with dementia in north west England. ‚ÄúI try not to think about dementia, ‚Äú she says. ‚ÄúI just think, well, if I don‚Äôt think about it, it might go away.‚Äù The @Guardian published this work. You can read the article by following the link in my bio and you can see more stories from this series by following @onedayinmyworld. And thank you to everyone sharing their own experience of friends and family living with dementia. It‚Äôs been deeply moving.
Photo by Robin Hammond @hammond_Robin ‚ÄúSometimes I don‚Äôt know, sometimes I do know.‚Äù This is 77 year-old July Hopkins describing her life with dementia. ‚ÄúI just, I just want to know what I was knowing. You understand? But sometimes it‚Äôs just okay.‚Äù I met July through a storytelling project on dementia made with my not for profit organisation @WitnessChange. I was deeply moved by the stories told by the individuals I met. They are just a few among millions. This chapter of the work was produced in northern England. #Dementia kills more people than any other disease in England and Wales. In 2017 it affected 50 million people globally. It will increase to over 150 million people by 2050. These shocking statistics are our parents and grandparents. Very soon they may be you and me. With no cure in sight, we can‚Äôt just think about how we avoid dying from dementia. We have to consider how to live with it. The @Guardian published this work.

"Photo by Robin Hammond @hammond_Robin. ‚ÄúI feel like, ‚Äòwhat about me, I have a voice, I have a brain, I can hear you,‚Äô but they think you don‚Äôt know, there‚Äôs something wrong with you, you can‚Äôt understand."" Fred is funny. He‚Äôs smart. But Dementia and Parkinson‚Äôs disease can make it difficult for the 78 year-old to express himself. Give him a chance though and he has a lot to say. He talks about dementia: ‚ÄúMy short term memory is gone. So you ask me about my last time, I can't remember, but you ask me about what happened on some day, I remember that.‚Äù One of the things that really upsets him the most is how he is treated: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frustrating, really frustrating, especially when people treat you like an idiot, in a wheel chair, like your brain is gone‚Ä¶ what I also find frustrating is that they don‚Äôt talk to you.‚Äù ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
There‚Äôs a lot online about how to communicate with people with dementia. I found this list helpful. It can help to:
* speak clearly and slowly, using short sentences * make eye contact with the person when they're talking or asking questions *give them time to respond, because they may feel pressured if you try to speed up their answers *encourage them to join in conversations with others, where possible *let them speak for themselves during discussions about their welfare or health issues *try not to patronise them, or ridicule what they say *acknowledge what they have said, even if they don't answer your question, or what they say seems out of context ‚Äì show that you've heard them and encourage them to say more about their answer *give them simple choices ‚Äì avoid creating complicated choices or options for them *use other ways to communicate ‚Äì such as rephrasing questions because they can't answer in the way they used to

Photo by Robin Hammond @hammond_Robin ‚ÄúThe thing that gives me joy, to a degree, is just being able to sit, be with her, hold her hand and just tell her I love her,‚Äù says Allan Bishop. ‚ÄúI get joy just that she‚Äôs still here.‚Äù Allan‚Äôs wife Kathleen (in this photo) was not able to answer my questions so Allan stepped in. They agreed to participate in this series I‚Äôve been making on #dementia, which continues work I‚Äôve been doing on mental health issues and neurological disorders for the last eight years - @onedayinmyworld. Amplifying the voices of people living at the heart of the issues we document is a central pillar of the work we do at @Witnesschange. In order to extend the reach of these voices we always try to find media partners to share the stories we‚Äôre helping to be told. The Guardian published this work.

"A few days ago folks at @witness_change hung some posters in Valencia. We thought it important to remind people that Refugees have lived through extreme difficulties - it‚Äôs why they fled their homes. And that life only becomes more difficult when they find themselves isolated after reaching safety. We told them (on the poster) that it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. #WelcomeRefugees. Here‚Äôs the post in the @onedayinmyworld account:
//
@WitnessChange created an outdoor¬†exhibition¬†featuring images of refugees standing in The Mediterranean waiting for a European country to accept them. We posted these on walls in Valencia, the first European city many refugees see. Despite the toxic language of some politicians, @onedayinmyworld, along with many in European host communities, want to say #refugeeswelcome"

Photo @Hammond_Robin. Zimbabwe‚Äôs former president Robert Mugabe is dead. I worked in Zimbabwe during what was arguably the country's most difficult years. I documented those at the front lines of Mugabe‚Äôs war against his own people and the decline of a beautiful and once promising nation. I grew a great affection for Zimbabwe and its embattled people which only made me more angry at those who stole their futures - people like President Mugabe. There was a lot of hope when Emmerson Mnangagwa wrestled power from Mugabe in 2017. I didn‚Äôt share it. The corrupt structures remained and taking charge of them was the man responsible for the massacre of thousands of Zimbabweans and the architect of the repression that defined Mugabe‚Äôs rule. No tears here for Robert Mugabe - only for a beautiful country that deserves better leaders.
Photo @hammond_robin for @Witness_Change. ‚ÄúSince Donald Trump was elected in 2016, things have changed quite a bit for me. I've felt a lot less secure. I've felt a lot more threatened.‚Äù I met Joann at her home in Titusville, Florida while working on the US chapter of @WhereLoveIsIllegal. I‚Äôm personally no fan of guns but given the very real threats many trans people face, I can understand why Joann keeps one. We spoke about many things other than politics. Joann told me, for example, about her transition which for her truly started when she had a breakdown and was hospitalised: ‚ÄúI did the boy things that people wanted me to do, and I kept pushing my feelings inward. On the outside, I did the things that boys and men were supposed to do. This continued for 30 years until July of 1989. That first day in a hospital, all my thoughts and actions of wanting to be a woman came rushing out. Now that is old history but it was the day that I felt that I let my feelings out. It was a day that my new life began.‚Äù I‚Äôm grateful to @thecenterorlando for introducing me to Joann. To see more of this US chapter of Where Love Is Illegal follow @whereloveisillegal
Photo @hammond_robin for @Witness_Change. Another hero falls. I met Marc in Cameroon in 2014, the country of his birth, the country that persecuted him, the country he chose to stay in rather than flee, because he knew his fight was a virtuous one. In 2005 Marc spent 12 months in prison ‚Äì charged with ‚Äòcommitting homosexuality‚Äô. He told me, ‚ÄúIt was a nightmare for me, but I transformed this nightmare into an opportunity ‚Äì it gave me the chance to denounce to the international community the situation of discrimination against people in my country for their sexual orientation or gender identity. Thanks to that a LGBT movement was born in Cameroon‚Äù. Marc may be gone, but his courage continues to inspire all of us who believe in equality.

Photo @hammond_robin ‚ÄúAfter all the excitement I then got my top surgery and It was a memorable moment for me because I wouldn‚Äôt have to layer up my clothing anymore and I was able to wear my shirt off and feel more comfortable in my skin.‚Äù Terry is a transgender man living in New York City. Until recently, Terry lived with his father and grandmother in Long Island. They (along with his aunt) were unique in Terry‚Äôs family for supporting him. After they both passed, Terry was homeless. He briefly lived with a friend from school while transitioning, but now lives in Trinity Place Shelter @tp_shelter, a transitional shelter for LGBTQI+ young people. ‚ÄúI didn't stay with my family because they don't accept me. They mis-gendered me ever since I was 11. They knew that I'm trans for about 10 years now. They called me my dead name. They call me a female still.‚Äù Some estimates put the number of homeless youth in The US who identify as LGBTQI+ as high as 40%. Many are homeless because of the stark choice given to them by their parents - either they deny their identity and stay home or live their truth and be homeless. For many, like Terry, this feels like no choice at all when hiding who they are  to make parents feel better can lead to severe mental health issues.

"syafakallah guruku tersayang

30 tahun lalu, seorang guru ngaji kampung yg sangat sederhana sedang melintasi jalan setapak menuju ke surau

ga sengaja, ia mendengar suara anak kecil lagi azan. Suara azan itu bukan dari surau, tapi dari sebuah gubuk kecil. ternyata anak itu sedang latihan azan bersama emaknya di rumah. Sang guru langsung menghampiri mereka ‚ÄúIbu, biar saya ajak anak ibu ini ke surau, agar dia bisa belajar ngaji di sana. Anak ini memiliki bakat suara yg bagus,‚Äù kata sang guru

Sejak saat itu, sang guru melatih si anak kecil di suraunya. Dan kelak, anak itu beberapa kali menjuarai lomba baca Quran tingkat nasional dan internasional

Setelah kuliah di Mesir, anak itu menjadi guru ngaji seperti gurunya. Alhamdulillah lewat dakwah anak itu, banyak anak muda yg kembali kepada Allah, bertaubat dan berhijrah

Semoga setiap kebaikan yg dilakukan  anak itu, menjadi pahala jariyah untuk sang guru
_______________

Bang Uin, itu panggilan akrab saya untuk guru yg telah membimbing saya dari nol ini ‚†Ä
‚ÄúSaya akan pulang Bang Uin, guruku...‚Äù
‚†Ä
syafakallah, wa kataballahu ajraka
___________

slide kedua itu anak beliau yg kecil. Dulu saya spt itu, mengaji di surau setiap magrib. Pake pengeras suara. Kalo pulang ke rumah, almarhumah Emak saya suka evaluasi bacaan saya. Saya tanya, emak dengar dr mana? dari pengeras suara di surau yg terdengar sampe ke ujung kampung, katanyaüòä

"Report hasil #sedekahsampah bulan November 2019

Kegiatan:
‚Ä¢ mengkampanyekan penggunaan #kajianstarterkit saat taklim, dimana peserta membawa tumbler sendiri dan bisa refill minuman gratis yg disediakan #pemudahijrah di depan masjid
‚†Ä
‚Ä¢ melakukan sedekah sampah. Mengumpulkan sampah kardus dan plastik dari jamaah kajian rabu dan sabtu setiap pekan nya
‚†Ä
‚Ä¢ menyerahkan sedekah sampah kepada partner, yaitu bank sampah resik. Dan menkonversi sampah menjadi uang untuk program beasiswa anak pemulung, atau bantuan sosial lainnya
‚†Ä
‚Ä¢ membuat program re-use sampah bersama anak2, di #lesswastekid saat kajian #ladiesday di masjid Allatif

Teman2, yuk ikutan, biar makin banyak sampah yg kita sedekahkah, jadi makin banyak anak pemulung yg bisa kita bantu

Buat jamaah yg mau support wakaf mobil bak, atau triseda.. mangga japri ke Aji 081395365242

Program #sedekahsampah #masjidlesswaste & #masjidperadaban ini dibina oleh guru2 kita #barisanbangunnegeri kolabs sama kang @gungunsaptari founder @kangpisman

"Merampungkan konsep lesswaste movement utk #masjidperadaban ... bersama dengan founder gagasan @kangpisman kota Bandung

InsyaAllah jadi berita baik untuk warga Bandung, karena sedikit demi sedikit masalah sampah ini akan kita beresin bersama2 sampai ke sumbernya

Berawal dari masjid, kita tampilkan Islam yg rahmatan lil Indonesia

"Alhamdulillah kemarin event kajian #barisanbangunnegeri dan #sedekahsampah di masjid MRKR Bintaro bersama gurunda Ustadz @oemar_mita berjalan lancar dan seru
________________
Uang hasil sedekah sampah ini akan kita kumpulin utk membiayai project sosial lain nya, seperti beasiswa enterpreneurship buat anak pemulung, atau kursus bengkel, jahit, dll... agar anak2 jalanan bisa punya skill utk berkarya dan mandiri

Doain ya, mudah2an makin banyak yg join bareng para guru mengisi #masjidperadaban .

"Dari sejak 2015, sebagian besar kegiatan dakwah saya dihabiskan di meja diskusi...bukan di mimbar

Kita berusaha menjadikan dakwah ini bukan sekedar ceramah, tapi harokah (movement) utk memprogram perubahan di tengah2 umat ke arah yg lebih baik

Tanpa kita sadari, di meja2 diskusi inilah lahir trend hijrah, crowd taklim, konten2 dakwah di sosmed, fenomena positif ttg pemuda, dll

Bukan hanya sendiri, tapi meja ini sering diramaikan oleh teman2 guru #barisanbangunnegeri dan para murid #santribangunnegeri 
Masih banyak yg perlu kita diskusikan. Masih banyak yg harus kita kerjakan secara kongkrit. Untuk membangun Indonesia bersama2. Jadi, kita ga boleh cepat lelah. Ga boleh gampang bosan

Tetap semangat sampai berhasil memanggungkan kembali Islam di muka bumi menjadi ""Rahmatan lil alamin""

"Keseruan malam kemarin #nongkrongbarenguha di stadion Singaperbangsa, bareng teh @cellicanurrachadiana dan pemuda2 Karawang... Mudah2an ke depan makin sering nongkrong2 spt ini di Karawang... biar makin religius dan nasionalis

Multonomah falls, one of the many natural wonders on the west coast‚ú® I‚Äôm often asked how I edit my photos and I want to show you lighting process most of my photos go through. If you swipe all the way to the last one you can see the original colors. It‚Äôs crazy to me how dark and desaturated it looks when in real life it was so much more vibrant. I use @adobecreativecloud and my first step was to put it in @Adobe @Lightroom where I was able to bring the yellows and oranges forward more like I remember it. The next step is adding a filter for a sightly more vintage feel. I then brightened it further and fine tuned some details like bringing the blue of my pants to a more natural tone.

It'll forever be very special to me. I'm so glad to see we kept going despite all the prejudice we encountered especially in the beginning, that we kept doing what we know best, with love, without fear. Farewell Bizim Hikaye!

"If you don't like the meats....look away now.

I went out for a little more culture last night and found the best steak I've ever had!! Genuinely.... I don't need to post this, I just feel like I should. The steak in Argentina is absolutely incredible...... I had a 600 gram filet mignon and didn't slow down once throughout. That coupled with some mega good malbec, made it a dinner I will not forget!

Then I got to meet the people responsible for the legendary hunk of meat in the kitchen of El Mirasol (that's the restaurant). This fella here clearly thinks I'm great. Couldn't cross my wrists for Heliotrope but maybe some Quen would give me the edge!

Well hello there, construction cutie. I hope you didn't lose your hard hat, because you're going to need it for what I want to do to you. I'm sure in for a busy Friday because it looks like I'll be operating some real heavy machinery. #HammerAndNailMe #SafetyFirst #hotdudesreading
This smokeshow daring to sit right in front of a no smoking sign looks like a real London rebel to me. I can tell by those sassy socks that there‚Äôs a wild side just waiting to be uncovered. Hope he hops off at the next stop with me and gives me a chance to see his other man buns. #topknotgoinghomealone #manbunmonday #hotdudesreading
Nothing like the sporty vibes of an L-train Knicks fan. Lay me up and call me a rebound, because I‚Äôve been doing my warmups all night long. Maybe you can tell me what an alley oop actually is while I alley oops my way into your bed. #PutMeInCoach #HeShootsHeScores #hotdudesreading
Headphones AND a book? This magnetic multi-tasker is practically begging me to hop on his lap and see how many other things he can handle simultaneously. And to top it off, he doesn‚Äôt come with any baggage. #IDoThough #ExcessBaggage #SizeMattersAmIRight #hotdudesreading
It‚Äôs #Halloween and I‚Äôm in the mood to dress up this lumberjack-o-lantern and find out exactly what kind of wood he‚Äôs working with. Run that scruff all over my face and show me how limber you are with that timber. #WoodYouBeMine #AxeMeOutAlready #HappyHalloween #hotdudesreading
Between my Hot Priest sighting and the Kanye‚Äòs #JesusIsKing, I‚Äòm feeling inspired to minister to everyone around me. In fact, I‚Äôm pretty sure God wants me to lay hands on this heavenly soul.

Is this an early Halloween costume or did the Hot Priest from @bbcfleabag just come to life in front of my eyes? Either way, just looking at this captivating clergyman's jawline and collar is giving me a steamy sense of Catholic guilt. Can I get an #AMEN? #ForgiveMeFather #ISpeakInTongues #ExorciseMe #hotdudesreading
This A-train babe is wearing so many layers that I just want to peel him like an onion. Don‚Äôt worry, by end of the night, we‚Äôll both be crying. You might accessorize better than me, but I can take off your shoelaces with my teeth. #ThoseBootsWereMadeForKnocking #AndThatsJustWhatWellDo #hotdudesreading
Well, hallo and guten tag to this spicy piece of Vienna sausage. And from the way my mouth is watering, you‚Äôd never suspect I just ate a massive lunch. Maybe my blood sugar is low again, but the urge to pound on some wiener schnitzel is all TOO real right now. #TenderMeat #hotdudesreading
Need to know immediately if this Power house wants to watch the debate with me tonight. Although there‚Äôs no faster way to heat things up than a healthy political discussion, I hope the only place he wants to go toe-to-toe with me on is in the bedroom.

‚ÄúI just feel like I should be doing better.  I‚Äôm nowhere near retirement.  I‚Äôm working two jobs: I‚Äôm a licensed tour guide, and I make videos for businesses.  But even that‚Äôs not enough, so recently I‚Äôve started working for the census.  I don‚Äôt want to run down the census: it‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs great, it‚Äôs important work.  But I‚Äôm ashamed of it.  Because I‚Äôm sixty-five years old, I'm a college graduate, and I‚Äôm supposed to be done by now.  I'm supposed to be coasting.  But I‚Äôm not even close.  I feel like I still don‚Äôt even have a grip on the basics: how to make a living, how to keep my house in order, how to take care of myself.  And it feels shameful.  I feel not grown up.  Like I should have learned all of this so long ago.  And I‚Äôm afraid people will think it‚Äôs pathetic.  Worse than that.  They‚Äôll think I‚Äôm incapable.  So I‚Äôve been keeping a lot hidden.  I haven‚Äôt even told my colleagues about the census.  And that‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôm trying to work on‚Äî not keeping things hidden.  Because I know this shame isn‚Äôt healthy.  It isn‚Äôt right.  I‚Äôm luckier than 99 percent of people.  I‚Äôve been sober for 39 years.  I have the greatest wife of 32 years.  I don't have any crippling debt.  I'm doing OK.  I shouldn‚Äôt have to hide my situation.  And being more open has helped.  Because once I start telling people, and I see they‚Äôre not judging me, and that they‚Äôre still loving me-- the shame tends to disappear.‚Äù
‚ÄúI vividly remember watching cartoons as a kid and seeing Bugs Bunny standing on a lily pad, playing ‚ÄòHello My Darling,‚Äô with a banjo in his hand and a drum on his back.  I‚Äôve always wanted to play music myself.  But it‚Äôs so hard to make a living at it.  For awhile I was playing the banjo in restaurants.  But I couldn‚Äôt make it work.  So I thought I‚Äôd try the Bugs Bunny thing.‚Äù
‚ÄúI moved from Texas three years ago.  I was way too nice at first.  I was out here in New York trying to exemplify Christ, and people were taking advantage of me.  I was getting run over.  So I had to get more stern.  Don't get me wrong-- I‚Äôm the same nice person, just more firm in my actions. Especially in the work environment.  My first job was working as a recruiter for a retail company.  And one day I‚Äôm on the computer, you know, recruiting people, which is my job-- when my boss comes in and says: ‚ÄòYou need to get to the floor, now!‚Äô I was in shock, so I just did what I was told.  But I knew the next time I‚Äôd have to say something.  My job was important to me, but respect was even more important. Because if I allowed him to treat me that way, it was just going to happen over and over.  And sure enough it happened again the next week.  I was in the middle of an important task, and he gave me a command.  There was no question mark on the end of the sentence.  There was no use of my name.  So I told him: ‚ÄòIf you want me to do something, you‚Äôll have to ask me the proper way.‚Äô He was shocked.  He looked at me like: ‚ÄòI know you‚Äôre not talking to me!‚Äô But then he asked me the proper way.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe started early in school.  Seven guys from my church got together and started practicing in a basement.  Michael Armstrong on drums.  Robert Burton on lead guitar.  James Cloud on bass.  Charles Easton on the piano.  Then we had our three singers: Wilbur Simmons, Dennis Austin Ray, and me.  At first we just sang on the sidewalk.  Or even just walking down the street.  But eventually we were getting real invitations to perform: parties, barbeques, little shows here and there.  Then we got bigger and bigger.  Until one night in 1969 we‚Äôre backing up Bobby Darin in front of 5,000 people at a college in New Jersey.  I was only fourteen at the time.  It was ecstasy.  The next ten years we toured up and down the east coast.  From Montreal to Pompano Beach, Florida.  We peaked in 1976.  That was the year we were booked forty weeks in advance.  There were signed contracts everywhere.  Even Frankie Valli wanted one of our songs.  But things fell apart.  Our rhythm guitarist died.  Some of the instrumentalists got married.  And Dennis went off on his own.  I was heartbroken.  Truly heartbroken. For ten years I‚Äôd done nothing but sing and party.  I hadn‚Äôt gone to school.  I hadn‚Äôt worked a job.  So I came to New York and did what I could to survive.  I‚Äôve worked as a super.  A maintenance man.  A baker at Kripsy Kreme.  But for the last eight years I‚Äôve been homeless.  Right now I‚Äôm sleeping in the hallway of a building where I collect the trash.  But I was in a great band once.  We were called ‚ÄòThe Uniques.‚Äô And I‚Äôve told you everyone‚Äôs name but mine: Vaughnterrol Lockette, lead tenor.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll of the young people are leaving.  You have to say ‚Äògoodbye,‚Äô over and over again.  One of my best friends went to Chile.  Another went to Spain.  Another went to Argentina to earn money for her mother‚Äôs cancer treatment.  My brother left five years ago.  And now I‚Äôm gone too.  Before I came to New York, I went to pick up some paperwork at my university.  We used to have ten classrooms full of people.  Now half of them are empty.  There are some people who choose to stay.  I have a cousin that swears he‚Äôll never leave.  He says that there‚Äôs a chance things will work out.  But that‚Äôs very rare for someone our age.  The grown-ups stay because they have their whole lives in Venezuela: maybe not their jobs anymore, but their houses and their cars.  But the young people want opportunities.  I want to be a designer.  But since there aren‚Äôt any design jobs, I‚Äôd have to be a freelancer.  But that‚Äôs also silly.  Because nobody has money for art or design.  Everyone needs their money for necessities.  So I‚Äôd be forced to take a job outside my career.  Anything I could get.  And that‚Äôs why I left.  Either you stay in Venezuela and make the decisions you have to.  Or you leave and make the decisions you want to.‚Äù
‚ÄúI grew up pretty well honestly.  I didn‚Äôt have bad parents‚Äîa little ‚Äòhelicoptery‚Äô maybe, but doing the best they could.  I was just a bad kid.  I don‚Äôt even remember a lot of my teenage years.  I was always popping pills.  Just a ‚Äòfuck you, parents‚Äô kind of thing.  When I wasn‚Äôt alone in my room, I was picking fights with them.  I hurt my mother the most because she cared the most.  Dad cared.  But Mom really cared.  Throwing me out wasn‚Äôt easy for her.  But one night I had a really bad Xanax high.  I blacked out.  Messed up the house.  They won‚Äôt even tell me exactly what I did-- but it must have been violent.  Because the cops came.  The court put an order of protection against me.  The last thing I said to my parents in the courtroom was: ‚ÄòI never want to see or hear from you again.‚Äô Then a few months later I called and begged to come home.  But it was too late.  My dad just kept saying: ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt.‚Äô There were long pauses.  And hesitation.  But he stuck to it.  It‚Äôs been eighteen months now.  I got clean.  Mainly because I‚Äôve been living in a shelter on Staten Island, and I just didn‚Äôt have the access.  Right now I‚Äôm trying to get into a longer term shelter.  Trying to find a job.  NY State has some scholarships that I‚Äôm looking at.  Dad‚Äôs coming to pick me up in an hour.  They‚Äôve invited me home for Thanksgiving.  I‚Äôm scared shitless.  It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve been home in over a year, and I‚Äôm spending three days with them.  I‚Äôm just hoping it‚Äôs like a normal Thanksgiving-- before I was a shit.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere was this interesting piece in The Times a couple weeks ago about people in solitary confinement.  And one of the guys said the worst thing is having all that time to think.  And that‚Äôs my problem too. When I‚Äôm alone in my apartment, I just start ruminating.  About my finances.  About my medical conditions.  About not taking good enough care of my mom.  But as long as I can find my bar, I‚Äôm fine.  It‚Äôs just a couple blocks from my house.  And when I open the door, and look in, I see the place is full of people like me: people with health problems, retirees with nothing to do, a lot of us are unkempt, unshaven.  And everyone has a weakness for alcohol.  I get a warm welcome every time I walk in.  It‚Äôs the only place I don‚Äôt berate myself for being a dirt bag.‚Äù
‚ÄúNobody would give us a chance.  We were in our early twenties.  We had two young kids.  We were working, but living check to check.  At the time we were staying in the projects with my mother-in-law, but my kids were growing up, so we needed our own place.  But all the rental brokers wanted to see our bank statements.  And we had no savings.  We didn‚Äôt even have accounts.  Then one day I was walking down the avenue, and I saw a super fixing up an empty apartment.  I told him I needed to speak to the landlord directly.  No brokers.  And I guess he liked my vibe, because he gave me the name: Ronald Petrowski.  When I called Mr. Petrowski, I explained everything.  I told him we needed a chance.  He agreed to meet me and my husband at Lenny‚Äôs Pizzeria.  He bought us a plain pie and listened to our story.  He‚Äôd grown up poor himself, so he knew the struggle.  And he gave us a chance.  We‚Äôve been in that apartment for 35 years now, and I‚Äôve paid him every cent.  We‚Äôve fallen on hard times.  At one point I owed him an entire year of rent.  But he was so gracious.  He never sent us an eviction notice.  Every time he came to collect, he‚Äôd sit at our kitchen table, have a cup of coffee, and listen to our situation.  Mr. Petrowski is my hero.  He sold the building a couple years ago, but we still keep in touch.  That man gave me a home to raise my children.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe scene was different back then.  All the adult clubs were mob controlled.  It all flowed up to some guy named Matty The Horse.  Honestly the mob guys never bothered me.  They were cool, and I liked how they dressed.  They wore custom made suits.  And they went to hair stylists, not barbers.  These guys wouldn‚Äôt even let you touch their hair when you were fucking them.  Not that I ever fucked them.  Because I never turned tricks.  Well, except for one time.  I took a job from this woman named Madame Blanche.  She controlled all the high dollar prostitutes back then.  She was like the Internet-- could get you anything you wanted.  And all the powerful men came to her because she never talked.  She set me up with a department store magnate who wanted a black girl dressed like a maid.  I thought I could do it.  But when I got to his hotel room, he wanted to spank me with a real belt.  So that was it for me.  I was done.  But Madame Blanche set my best friend Vicki up with The President every time he came to New York.  And don‚Äôt you dare write his name cause I can‚Äôt afford the lawyers. But he‚Äôd always spend an hour with her.  He‚Äôd send a car to pick her up, bring her to his hotel room, put a Secret Service agent in front of the door, and get this: all he ever did was eat her pussy!‚Äù
‚ÄúMy stripper name was Tanqueray.  Back in the seventies I was the only black girl making white girl money.  I danced in so many mob clubs that I learned Italian.  Black girls weren‚Äôt even allowed in some of these places.  Nothing but guidos with their pinky rings and the one long fingernail they used for cocaine.  I even did a full twenty minutes in the place they filmed Saturday Night Fever.  But I made my real money on the road.  Three grand on some trips.  Every time Fort Dix had their pay day, they‚Äôd bring me in as a feature and call me ‚ÄòMs. Black Universe‚Äô or some shit like that.  I had this magic trick where I‚Äôd put baby bottle tops on my nipples and squirt real milk, then I‚Äôd pull a cherry out of my G-string and feed it to the guy in the front row.  But I never used dildos on stage or any shit like that.  Never fucked the booking agents.  Never fucked the clients.  In fact, one night after a show, I caught another dancer sneaking off to the Tate Hotel with our biggest tipper.  Not allowed.  So the next night we put a little itching powder in her G-string.  Boy did she put on a show that night.  Didn‚Äôt see her again until ‚ÄòThe Longest Yard‚Äô with Burt Reynolds.  So I guess she finally fucked the right one.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy mom threw me out of the house at seventeen for getting pregnant, then had me arrested when I tried to get my clothes. Then she fucked the head of parole to try to keep me in jail. She was some prime pussy back then. But the warden did some tests on me and found out I was smart, so I got a scholarship to go anywhere in New York. I chose the Fashion Institute of Technology, which I hated. But by that time I was already getting work making costumes for the strippers and porn stars in Times Square. All my friends were gay people, because they never judged me. All I did was gay bars: drag queen contests, Crisco Disco, I loved the whole scene. And I couldn‚Äôt get enough of the costumes. My friend Paris used to sit at the bar and sell stolen clothes from Bergdorf and Lord and Taylors, back before they had sensor tags. So I had the best wardrobe: mink coats, 5 inch heels, stockings with seams up the back. I looked like a drag queen, honey. One night a Hasidic rabbi tried to pick me up because he thought I was a tranny. I had to tell him: ‚ÄòBaby, this is real fish!‚Äù

"December üéÑ ‚ÄúLe preguntaron a Mahatma Gandhi cuales eran los factores que destruyen al ser humano. Tranquilo y sereno respondi√≥ as√≠:

La Pol√≠tica sin principios, el Placer sin compromiso, la Riqueza sin trabajo, la Sabidur√≠a sin car√°cter, los Negocios sin moral, la Ciencia sin humanidad y la Oraci√≥n sin caridad. 
La vida me ha ense√±ado que la gente es amable, si yo soy amable; que las personas est√°n tristes, si estoy triste; que todos me quieren, si yo los quiero; que todos son malos, si yo los odio; que hay caras sonrientes, si les sonr√≠o; que hay caras amargas, si estoy amargado; que el mundo est√° feliz, si yo soy feliz; que la gente se enoja, si yo me enojo; que las personas son agradecidas, si yo soy agradecido.

La vida es como un espejo: Si sonr√≠o, el espejo me devuelve la sonrisa. La actitud que tome frente a la vida, es la misma que la vida tomar√° ante m√≠.‚Äù ‚ÄúEl que quiera ser amado, que ame‚Äù."

I came, I saw, I conquered. Thank you @lagalaxy for making me feel alive again. To the Galaxy fans -  you wanted Zlatan, I gave you Zlatan. You are welcome. The story continues...Now go back to watch baseball
I‚Äôve had my fair share of battles on the pitch, but nothing compares to what these players have tackled in life. Gatans lag - you have¬†my respect. #Number10 @VolvoCarSverige
How are you liking #VWars ?!?!?!?!? Let me know. I can‚Äôt wait to dive in and answer as many of your questions as I can!
My view right now. Doing a satellite media tour talking to you all over the USA!
Official photo! I made it Mom! Wall Street! I‚Äôm coming for you! The future of business is companies with triple bottom lines:  PEOPLE. PLANET. PROFIT This as true as the sky is blue. As true as water is wet. Its also, just the right thing to do. We have no choice. Millennials and Gen Z are going to power this change and people like me and my companies like @imrituals and our BOURBON Company are going to help give them the tools to do it. Let‚Äôs not just put our focus into sustainability but rather regeneration. Sustainability is important-do not get me wrong but it will not solve our problems. Regenerative farming and business practices will. When we build a regenerative economy, our climate crisis and our biggest issues will disappear. It‚Äôs time. It starts NOW. I got to Executive Produce a film called Kiss the Ground @kisstheground with an amazing filmmaker and team that will show you this so simply and beautifully. I can‚Äôt wait for you to see it. Thank you so very much @cnbc and @nyse for giving me the chance to talk about my passions. I believe with steadfast conviction that we will change the world through business, education and regeneration.
I‚Äôm live here at the @nyse talking to @cnbc The Closing Bell! Log on!!! I‚Äôm here To talk about Damon and Stefan‚Äôs BOURBON!!
So cool to be here right now! @BuildseriesNYC . Working like mad from the green room and will be live 3PM EASTERN STANDARD TIME Talking about #VWars that DROPS TONIGHT on @netflix in 13hrs

"Two days in the Island with inspiring women 
@laagam______"
Is it the weekend yet? Tayto wants to know...
Sustainability is something that always felt really overwhelming for me, so a few years ago, I started thinking about changes I could make in small, doable steps. The first and most noticeable was changing my relationship with shopping. I've now adopted a slow fashion approach that feels good for me. My spending habits have changed too. I used to be focused on accumulating things, but now I prefer investing in experiences that will enrich my creativity. When I do buy things, I know the deeper why. When it comes to beauty, I use up products completely and am mindful about what I will realistically use on a regular basis. I've been using this @eosproducts hand cream every. single. day. since I got it and I love it even more because it's made with sustainably sourced shea butter. When I started this journey of exploring sustainability, I was scared because I thought I'd be losing things I loved like the fun of putting together a new outfit and the comforting pleasure of a beauty routine. Turns out, I didn't lose those things ‚Äì they expanded and shifted to change with me. Whenever I start feeling overwhelmed, I look back at my trail of small steps I've taken over the years knowing that they all added up to get me where I am now. Tbh I gotta say, I like it here! All I have to do today is focus on the next small step right in front of me, knowing if I follow that simple rule, I'll like where I land in the future. #eoshandcream #eossheabetter #eosawesome #sponsored
Spent the holiday weekend in the Midwest and it was even better having this little FLOOF with us! ‚ù§Ô∏èSide note: please look at the last photo because OMG THOSE LIL EARS PEEKIN‚Äô OUT!! üò≠ü•∞
What #slowfashion means to me: 1) shopping less and creating outfits with things I already have in my closet. 2) when I do shop, shopping more secondhand. 3) if I buy something new, asking myself ‚Äúis this something I can wear for years to come?‚Äù With the holidays coming up, shopping is definitely on my mind. I‚Äôve made a short list of purchases to help keep me on a focused and mindful path this year. What about you? Have your shopping habits changed? How are you approaching holiday shopping this year? I‚Äôd love to know ‚ù§Ô∏è Outfit details: everything I‚Äôm wearing is at least 2-3 years old, except for jewelry which was gifted to me.
See the heart in the right corner? That‚Äôs the @CVS_Beauty Mark and it means this photo hasn‚Äôt been retouched. #ad (Fun fact: I‚Äôve never retouched my own IG photos!) Last year¬†CVS¬†announced its commitment to healthy standards and transparency in their beauty imagery by introducing this¬†CVS¬†Beauty Mark to highlight images that haven‚Äôt been materially altered. Now, they‚Äôre taking another step and making ingredient transparency more accessible too. If you‚Äôre choosing to move away from certain ingredients in your personal care products,¬†CVS¬†now has thousands (!!!) of Clean Beauty products. You can also look for the little green ‚ÄúParaben and Pthalate Free‚Äù sticker on their¬†CVS¬†Health and Beauty 360 packaging. Click the link in my bio to check out some of my favorite products! Oh, and don‚Äôt forget: you can get money back and earn rewards when you buy beauty products by joining the¬†CVS¬†Beauty Club! #BeautyUnaltered

"Thank you to everyone who shared your tips for fighting stress on my IGTV giveaway! Here are the 5 winners who will receive the entire @cledepeaubeaute Key Radiance Care range that I‚Äôve been talking about recently. I love these small, doable steps for dissolving stress ‚Äì I'm definitely taking notes!
@ariellebc13 ‚ÄúI really enjoy writing letters to my friends in other places when I‚Äôm feeling stressed or sad!‚Äù
@maggie.onthemove ‚ÄúI manage stress by walking my dog everyday. I leave the phone at home and connect with nature instead. It really clears my mind!‚Äù
@quinnsculthorpe ‚ÄúI try to get ahead of my stress by writing my daily intentions in my journal as soon as I wake up in the morning.‚Äù
@mtmt.ttt ‚ÄúüåüI stay away from social media. This is the new easy way to go ‚Äúmindless‚Äù. I also have a space where I can sit and take deep breaths when I am overwhelmed. Its either in my bed or a chair where I can sit up and go through my 4-7-8 breathing.‚Äù

2019 vs. 2009. Today marks 10 years since posting the first video that‚Äôs up on my YouTube channel. It feels like a lifetime ago. From my earliest memories I have always been creative ‚Äì drawing, writing, building things, experimenting in the kitchen with no purpose other than to play. When my dad died in 2006, I stopped playing. I didn‚Äôt make anything for three years. That‚Äôs a long time in my creative world. It‚Äôs hard for me now to go a week without making something let alone three years. My dad was my creative support growing up ‚Äì there was always room for creativity, no matter how much physical space it took up or how messy it got. When the outside world didn‚Äôt believe in my vision, my dad always did. His encouragement quieted the voices of harsh critics (my own included) and my instincts were allowed to shine. When he died, all of that went away. Suddenly, being creative felt like a painful memory of what I‚Äôd lost. I was depressed, angry, devastated and confused. I dreaded mornings because getting out of bed felt impossible, yet at night, I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep because my world felt so lonely. Discovering YouTube changed everything. I starting creating again, energized by my ideas and feeling challenged as I brought them to life. My confidence wasn‚Äôt discovered in this process but uncovered. It was there all along, it was just a little dusty. My creativity came back in a new form and it has carried me to so many places over the last decade ‚Äì my first apartment on my own, my career, coming out, friendships that I‚Äôll treasure forever (@eileeneveryday + @carrierad, this one‚Äôs for you), The White House and New York City. Remarkably, it has also brought me into your lives. It is the greatest gift to have touched just one other life and it‚Äôs an even greater gift knowing how much you‚Äôve touched mine. Life has expanded immensely beyond those four blue walls from my childhood bedroom, but there are two things that haven‚Äôt changed ‚Äì 1. my love for an inner corner highlight and red lip and 2. my deep faith in creativity as survival. Creativity led me here, planting the seeds for the roots I feel grounded in today. Thank you for growing with me.‚ù§Ô∏è
Growing up I always thought ‚ÄúI for sure want to be a mom!‚Äù but lots of things have changed since then. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what I want anymore. Being 30, queer and unsure about whether or not I want to have kids has been difficult. Especially when it seems like everyone else is so certain about where they stand (I know the reality is, lots of people are unsure). When @NorthwellHealth reached out to see if I wanted to come to their event tonight, it was an enthusiastic YES for me because 1. this is something that‚Äôs on my mind daily and 2. I saw that LGBTQIA+ family planning was front and center on their fertility page. This immediately made me feel seen. I have a million and one questions about options, the process, and well‚Ä¶ ALL OF IT. I‚Äôve been avoiding this for a while because tbh I‚Äôm scared. What if  l wait too long? What if I‚Äôm infertile? What if I don‚Äôt want to carry? What if I do? Years ago, I was given some great advice: avoidance is not a strategy. Honestly, this popped into my inbox at the perfect time because as of tonight, I‚Äôm officially not avoiding this conversation with myself anymore. I‚Äôm learning, gathering information and taking notes ‚Äì all in a safe and fun environment. (There were games! Hence the tickets in my hands üòé) I genuinely have no idea where I‚Äôll land in the future, but what I do know for sure is that for right now, it‚Äôs okay to not be sure. Thank you #NorthwellHealthFertility for bringing us all together tonight.‚ù§Ô∏è#IlluminateYourOptions #ad
We have been calling Tayto ‚Äúbaby Simba‚Äù and I think he‚Äôs lukewarm about it... but he got to go to his favorite place (the beach!) so I think he‚Äôs willing to endure the new nickname üòèüê∂üíï

"Victoria Garrick (@victoriagarrick) is no stranger to finding balance in the face of pressure. As a public speaker, content creator and former student athlete, she speaks openly about the real pressures of social comparison. ‚ÄúThe pressure to be perfect stems from a societal belief that perfection is the only way to be good enough,‚Äù says Victoria. ‚ÄúI tried to attain these unrealistic standards of beauty, get straight As in school, become a star athlete and constantly seem happy. I was so consumed with portraying a perfect image and pretty Instagram aesthetic that I lost sight of what it meant to be me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhen I finally realized I was living for likes and validation from others online, I wanted to find a way to get back to being real and authentic.‚Äù‚Å£

"Estaba guardando esta foto para publicarla junto a buenas noticias.

Hace una semana compartimos la historia de estos tres hermanos @DavidPlacer y yo.

Los j√≥venes llegaron a Madrid en condici√≥n de refugiados, huyendo de Venezuela.
Su condici√≥n era tan grave que no contaban ni siquiera con un lugar para pasar la noche. Desde el momento que se hizo publica la historia y gracias al impecable seguimiento que le ha dado David, los chicos fueron apoyados por varias familias venezolanas, logrando el d√≠a de hoy ingresar en el programa de protecci√≥n integral del refugiado del gobierno espa√±ol.
Estar√°n viviendo en un apartamento para refugiados en Sevilla por seis meses hasta que el gobierno les conceda el permiso de trabajo.

Gracias a todos los que se involucraron en el caso y contribuyeron en poder lograr este positivo desenlace.

Gracias al periodista @Davidplacer por tu profesionalismo y genuina disposici√≥n al servicio de los dem√°s.

"Es muy com√∫n presenciar a personas que asocian la paz con seguridad proporcionada por un buen estado financiero, un trabajo estable; adjudicando todo al esfuerzo humano. 
El estado actual de diferentes econom√≠as en varios pa√≠ses nos demuestra que la anterior  forma de pensar no es mas que una ilusi√≥n, la cual puede deshacerse como polilla en cuestiones de d√≠as, en ocasiones solo se necesitan horas. ¬øCu√°ntos fueron movidos por la desesperaci√≥n buscando paz en otra tierra y en el presente, la naci√≥n que brind√≥ calma moment√°nea se est√° desestabilizando a una velocidad preocupante?

En mis √∫ltimos d√≠as tuve la bendici√≥n de estar en dos ciudades de Espa√±a y recientemente en M√©xico, en mi caminar lo que m√°s observe fue emigrantes buscando esa paz. 
Es importante aclarar que no me refiero solamente a venezolanos, vi a sirios, et√≠opes, ecuatorianos, hondure√±os, guatemaltecos, rusos, colombianos, indios, libaneses y pare de contar. Personas que huyen en b√∫squeda de sosiego, almas que sufren quemaduras por causa de una olla hirviendo llamada tierra. 
Hoy quiero recordar por este medio lo siguiente; para lograr conquistar la verdadera paz, una efectiva que perdure en el tiempo y se mantenga en nosotros sin importar las circunstancias debemos meditar, aceptar, recibir y atesorar las palabras que el hijo de Dios nos dej√≥:

Cristo nos entrega la distinci√≥n, una paz moment√°nea (la del mundo) una paz que proviene de √âl (la eterna). Esta palabra proviene del hebreo Shalom, significa estar entero, completo, seguro.
Es como si en este vers√≠culo el Se√±or hiciese un testamento para nosotros.

Por eso Pablo dice en ùêÖùê¢ùê•ùê¢ùê©ùêûùêßùê¨ùêûùê¨ ùüí:ùüï  que sobrepasa el entendimiento dicha paz, 
ni tu mismo entender√°s porque est√°s en calma en situaciones dif√≠ciles. Esto solo se logra con Cristo.

Puedes reconocer que la tienes si en medio de la tormenta permaneces confiado.

"My good friend and colleague of many years, Bill Allard is having his bi-annual print sale. These are his words:

As  part  of my  bi-annual flash  sale,  I  am  offering  this  signed  print  at $100  for  a three  week  period beginning November  4th  and  ending on  November  25th  at  11:59  pm (EST). This  flash  sale  print  is  a  6‚Äù  x 9‚Äù  image  on  a 9‚Äù  x  11‚Äù  paper.  It  is  an  archival  ink  jet  print  on  archival  watercolor  paper.  It  is  signed  ID‚Äôd in  graphite  pencil  on  the  front  border. Photo  by  @williamalbertallard // Stan  Kendall at  the  Miner's  Club  Bar -  Mountain  City,  Nevada,  1979 The  buckaroo  crew  and  I  went  in  one  day  to  get  supplies  at  the  tiny  hamlet  of  Mountain  City,  Nevada. Far from  being  a  city,  the  community  consisted  then,  as  I  recall,  of  a couple  of bars  and  a grocery  store.  There  may  have  been  more,  I  think  there  may  have  been  a brothel.  Brothels  are  legal in  Nevada;  it‚Äôs been  a  long time  and  it‚Äôs  hard  to  remember.  The  picture  of  Stan  Kendall  was  made  in  late  afternoon  and  there  was  sunlight  blasting  through  the  door of the  Miner‚Äôs  Club  and  there  was  lots  of red:  Stan‚Äôs  shirt,  the  bar‚Äôs  curtains,  the  wainscoting  of  the  bar, and  the  tops  of the  bar stools.  It  was  if the  entire  room  was  bleeding.  Stan  is  kind  of slumped  there  on the  stool,  a  faraway  look  on  his  face.  He  had  what  I  called  back  then,  that ‚Äúleaving look.‚Äù And  he  did  so the  next  day,  packing up  his  bedroll  and  saddle,  picking up  his  pay,  and  heading  to  another  job  on another  ranch  somewhere  down  the  road."

"Images from my years in Greenland are part of this years print sale. Today is last day at www.jacobauesobol.com
Living and working with the hunters and their families I always felt close to life and death. I learned that Nature is not only something we move around in - but something we are.
2nd hand copies of my book ""Sabine"" from Greenland are also on sale today only."
"I have a twin brother. His name is Thomas. He is 3 minutes
younger than me, 3 cm taller and weighs 3 kilos less.
When we were born the story goes that Thomas send me out in the world to check if everything was OK. Being alone for a few minutes I panicked, and I lured him to come out as well.
We were called A & B. In the years to come we were rarely called by our separate names. Just ""The Twins"". We were impossible to split. We created our own world together. A language that only we understood. We shared everything. First our dreams and later our secrets.
One day our father was killed. Together we had to
tell our mother. From that day Thomas and I lost the world
we had created together. We were no longer able to be close. Still it is when I'm near him that I feel most safe.
Images of twins from Russia, Denmark and America are a part of this years print sale ending tomorrow. Take a look at www.jacobauesobol.com"
"‚ÄúTo me the camera has always been a tool to find and depict love. How close can I get to a love that feels true in my images?‚Äù
All images are part of this years print sale at www.jacobauesobol.com"
Many new images of mine are part of this years print sale. Visit www.jacobauesobol.com to see all of them:)
"From my book ""By the River of Kings"". 2016.

All images available this week as part of our Winter Print Sale. 100 euro for a signed museum quality print (Hahnem√ºhle Baryta 320g) framed or in a cloth-bound box. 24x24cm - visit our store at www.jacobauesobol.com

The Chao Phraya River is the lifeblood of Thailand. It is born as the Ping and Nan rivers become one. From there its waters flow south to Bangkok. These pictures are a recording of what I saw and the people I met along The River of Kings in Bangkok."
"I lived with The Gomez Brito family in a remote, mountainous area of Guatemala for two months. Every day I took part in the daily work on their land, growing corn and beans. Juanita and Andreas had seven children: Roberto, Davide, Faustino, Eliseo, Diego, Elisabeth and Maria. They also had a dog named Domingo. Domingo would follow ten-year-old Eliseo every morning when he walked the long route over the mountain to tend to the horses. Often on the way back old Domingo got really tired, and Eliseo would carry him the rest of the way home.
The images from Guatemala are part of my yearly print sale where you can purchase a museum quality print in 24x24cm for 100 euro. Only this week. You can see the entire selection at www.jacobauesobol.com or by using link in profile."

My name is Mrs. Maisel, thank you and goodnight!¬†üéô‚ú®¬†I relate to Midge from @maiseltv in so many ways, for example I also own too many hats... but more importantly¬†how she stands up for her true passion no matter what anyone else thinks. My entire life I‚Äôve been an art kid wanted to go to art school and pursue blogging, which was a really hard thing for me to explain to my parents/family.¬†¬†I love that Midge just goes for what she wants! She‚Äôs a powerful female figure that I strongly suggest tuning into, season 3 is available now on @amazonprimevideo! #MrsMaisel #SponsoredByPrimeVideo

the amount of shit we‚Äôve fought through in the past 2 years I wouldn‚Äôt wish upon anybody - we‚Äôre warriors - lions - never satisfied - industry innovators - the only thing that can stop us is ourselves - and we‚Äôve certainly done SO - I think it was the way we were raised - but the general public doesn‚Äôt fancy ‚Äúthe pauls‚Äù - we‚Äôre polarizing - controversial - opinionated - loud - f**k boys - douchebags - cringey - and the list goes on - we‚Äôve heard it all before and twice more - but our friends, family, & fans understand us & our vision - what we‚Äôre really like as humans - not just our internet personas - we love you guys - tho our enemies pay close attention & our haters will soon straighten out - the past year or so has been emotionally & mentally difficult for both logan and I - lots of fight - lots of adversity - but we‚Äôre not here to complain & play victim - we stayed silent - dealt with our shit and let actions speak - training camp is over - and the fight less than 72 hours away & logan gets to step into that ring & show the world on behalf of our family that nothing can stop what we set out to accomplish and that we have the best fans and support system in the world - i‚Äôll be in logan‚Äôs corner screaming along side @justinbieber while I patiently await my opportunity to decapitate @ksi

Rashid @jackedjeanswbff is possibly the busiest guy I‚Äôve known for a while, running two separate gyms in Manchester. 
His goals were to drop around 15kg in bodyfat, and gain a couple of kg muscle in his ‚Äúweaker‚Äù areas.
.
With his sights set on the @wbff_official California show in Oct 2019, it was my job to do the following:
- Keep his diet SIMPLE
- Keep him accountable
- Deliver appropriate and time efficient workouts!
- Put up with his short temper and occasional memory loss üòú
.
Rashid smashed it and took 3rd at a competitive show, improving greatly on his previous show where he took 9th.
.
We are now looking at 2020 shows and he‚Äôll be bigger and better! Rashid is an accomplished S&C coach and weight loss expert so get in touch if you need a trainer like that in Manchester!

I worked with Mazen @batmaz13 for 6 months earlier this year and we were both happy with the results he achieved! ü§©
.
His goals were to target stubborn areas which for him were mainly Chest and Calves, but as with many trainees he wanted to keep his condition in check throughout! We allowed a few weeks at the end to get him ‚Äúbeach ready‚Äù for summer holidays - as this was his main goal!
.
One of our biggest wins was using frequent changes in #intensity and #frequency on key bodyparts to keep him progressing, and also manipulating diet carefully so he didn‚Äôt need to spend too many hours on the treadmill!

"Have you ever done any of these?üßê
.
Having coached many females competitors to the highest level over the last 5 years these are some common mistakes that i have seen:
.
1: Focusing on Glutes too much! üçë 
The fitness world got Glute obsessed over the last few years, and yes female competitors do need round firm glutes, but you need the WHOLE PACKAGE or your (often) genetically weaker upper body could let you down.
Do not see glute training as a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù or a simple route to getting Bikini Comp ready!
Instead, take an objective and holistic look at your physique and make steady improvements to all relevant areas.
.
2: Too few calories, for too long! ü§ï
All too often the female trainee enters a massive calorie deficit often just above BMR/RMR and loses a tonne of muscle eventually. Yeah that muscle that took ages to build!
Increase your work volume over time and carefully manage your deficit instead!
.
3: Underestimating menstrual cycle ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Rapid weight fluctuations, changes in mood and appetite can seriously mess with your head when you‚Äôre just a few weeks out! üò©
Make an action plan, get comfortable with some water weight gain - and accept this temporary state üëåüèº
.
Which of the above resonates with YOU the most?? Comment below - or drop me a DM with your story!

The stunner in the photo is @morgs_j_fit who managed to avoid these problems with my guidance. She‚Äôs now ranked 3rd in Europe as Pro Bikini Diva with @wbff_official.

"5 key mindsets üß† separating WINNERS from the rest!
(Comment below which 1-5 resonates the most with YOU!)
.
1: Before SUCCESS, many failures may come. Learn from your falls, get up and grow stronger!
.
2: Focus on improving yourself and NOT comparing to others! You have zero control over your competition.
.
3: The JOURNEY itself must be enjoyable, rather than a pure focus on the  results!
.
4: One missed workout won‚Äôt derail you, and one bad meal will NOT make you fat. Dust yourself off after a bad day, and GET ON WITH IT.
.
5: When you walk on stage - assume you‚Äôve already WON, and present to the crowd like they are there just for YOU!

A very special #Caturday as I have videos of a snuggle between best friends Liberty (a lion) and Tiger Lily (a tiger) at @noahsarkclub yesterday, as well as us sharing enrichment items with the great, lovable tiger Doc and sweet Liberty. Noah‚Äôs Ark is a sanctuary that has saved more than 1,500 animals, many of them previously owned as illegal pets or in roadside zoos and circuses or used in scientific experiments, and who can‚Äôt be returned to the wild. Please follow @noahsarkclub here on Instagram and show your support! #happycaturday #cat #cats #catsofinstagram #lion #tiger
Of the many great experiences today at @noahsarkclub was meeting Anna Lou, a very friendly Grizzly who was rescued by Noah‚Äôs Ark. As a cub, Anna Lou was rented out to people for a weekend or overnight. Being shuffled from person to person and being removed from her mother at far too early an aged caused enormous anxiety and behavioral issues. Today at 4 1/2 years old she is happy at Noah‚Äôs Ark rescue with a huge area to romp and play and take part in one of her favorite enrichment activities - painting (non-toxic children‚Äôs paints of course!) Some of her great works can be seen in the last photo above. Before that you can see Anna Lou just sitting and hanging out with me as I told her how beautiful she was, which she seemed to love. If you want to help Anna Lou and other rescue animals please consider making a small donation to @noahsarkclub. ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Happy Holidays loves! üéÑ 
This is my absolute favourite time of the year but also the most emotional. Growing up, we didn‚Äôt have much but I really appreciate being brought up that way because the true meaning of Christmas (and just everyday life) is about loved ones and spending time together, eating, drinking wine and just really feeling grateful for the things we have right now. Growing up I was so thankful for a roof over our head, food on our table and everyone in good health. It is hard at times as many of our family members are not in our lives anymore which I‚Äôm sure a lot of people out there also have to deal with. This year for Christmas, I decided to get something for my sister that I love but will always have me attached to it. I got her and I @Guerlain Rouge G customizable lipsticks, engraved on the mirrors, hers says ‚ÄòJanice‚Äô and mine says ‚ÄòHalle‚Äô which I thought was a perfect way to remind eachother that while we have been through a lot and life gets crazy, we will always have eachother as sisters forever.

This is us out for our first walk since üë∂üèº arrived, I was nervous and scared that he would cry but at the same time so happy to be outside after 5 days indoors. üôà As you can see we have to practice stroller-time, he wanted to hang out in our arms instead... üòÇ Also - you guys are so curious about his name, it‚Äôs almost too fun to keep it a secret haha! We‚Äôll share it tonight though, don‚Äôt you worry! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs ours üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks life for this amazing gift. Ps. I‚Äôve been thinking about posting this for 3 hours now but then he wanted food, then diaper change, some crying and then some more eating. üòÇ Now he‚Äôs half asleep in my arms and I‚Äôm writing this with one hand, guessing this is life from now on and I love it. üôà‚ù§Ô∏è
Before this IG turns in to baby spam deluxe (oh it will, my phone is already getting full of photos and videos of our little boy... üë∂üèº haha!) I have one photo to post. When I can start wearing perfume again I will go back to my all time favorite from @lancomeofficial, the #Id√¥le perfume (I switch it up with La Vie Est Belle üåπ that I use some days too!). I love the concept of it - be your own idol. Something I think everyone should be! üëäüèΩ It‚Äôs a perfect gift to your mom/sister/friend or to yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è #lancome #happinessishere
HE‚ÄôS FINALLY HERE!!!! üò≠‚ù§Ô∏èüë∂üèº‚ù§Ô∏è 19/11-19. ‚ù§Ô∏è I had no idea my heart had such a big hole that now is filled, words can‚Äôt even describe. üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è We‚Äôre all feeling great and he‚Äôs a healthy, curious and happy (and very sleepy) little boy. Welcome to the world my little love, we can‚Äôt wait to spend the rest of our lives together with you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è We did it @jonolsson1 - JAG √ÑLSKAR DIG!

Today marks the 10 year anniversary of the THIS IS WAR album release. This record is about survival. We had a very intense time making this one. It was a two-year creative battle that was ferocious and tough but creatively rewarding, and all of those adverse elements made us stronger and made the record stronger. The old clich√©‚Äîwhatever does not kill you, makes you stronger‚Äîis true. What‚Äôs your favorite song from #THISISWAR? #thisiswarmonth

Hurling through the air over the far southern reaches of New Zealand, a place far separated from us humans & where nature still has a chance to thrive & prosper..
Details from Sakurajima, the most active volcano in all of Japan that we were lucky enough to see have multiple small eruptions during our time in Kagoshima. Hands down one of the craziest things I‚Äôve ever seen. @visitjapanau #visitjapanau #japanrevealed
"Japan or Cappadocia?  This wasn‚Äôt a scene I was ever expecting to see the when visiting Japan but during my recent visit I was lucky enough to attend the 40th anniversary of the Saga Ballon Fiesta. It was one of those I don‚Äôt believe this is happening moments when I looked up to see 100s of balloons floating in the sky almost as far as the eye could see, who ever knew this was in Japan? This trip to Kyushu has definitely opened my mind on how incredible Japan is and if you take the time to travel out of well known regions you might find a side of Japan you may never expected. 
@visitjapanau #visitjapan #japanrevealed"
"Surviving typhoons, world wars and located on a rugged and isolated peninsula the Yakushima lighthouse was built in 1897 & is actually one of the oldest lighthouses in all Japan. Kyushu has provided some many unexpected scenes and the coastline of Yakushima is provided a different side of Japan that I‚Äôve never seen before.

Sassy Portrait of the Yakushima macaque a subspecies of the Japanese macaque that‚Äôs indigenous to Yakushima.

"Day 1 in Japan and I arrived in Kagoshima the southernwestern most city of Kyushu which  lays in the shadow of Sakuarajima, one of Japan‚Äôs most active volcanos.

Winter scenes in the fall on the road to Mt Rainier.. @visitbellevue #VisitBellevue
One of those classic wet and moody days on the Olympic peninsular on the trail dwarfed by giant trees some upwards of a 1000 years old.. well worth the drive and scenic ferry across Puget Sound from our trip to @visitbellevue #visitbellevue
An unseasonal snow storm swept through in early September blanketing the surrounding peaks and valleys of Mt Rainier NP during my recent visit to Washington. We started early leaving Bellevue our base for the week in the hope of catching first light and arrived to some of the most incredible conditions although unexpected 2 and a half months before winter.

#AD I want to share my promise with you all in collaboration with @jlo exciting new fragrance, promise, available at the @fragranceshopuk. Once I got out of my dark space I made a promise to myself to try and think positively no matter what and be grateful for what I‚Äôve got (even if things aren‚Äôt going to plan). I had my daughter nearly 3 years ago and since having her I‚Äôve realised how short life is... the years are literally flying by and I don‚Äôt want to waste any of my life. I know I never want to be in that dark place again. It felt impossible to get out of it, I was a prisoner of my own head. Knowing I never want to be like that again, I made a promise to myself, to cherish life and not worry about things I know I won‚Äôt worry about when I‚Äôm an old lady. I can‚Äôt control everything that happens in my life but I can choose how I react to things. Thank you @jlo for letting me share my promise of self love and being comfortable with myself. What promises have you made to yourself and why did you make these promises? Let me know! Head over to my stories to find out where you can purchase this amazing fragrance. #ipromise #whatsyourpromise #jlo #jlobeauty

"Fam!
The holidays can bring out some stressful feelings when it comes to food, especially guilt. However, enjoying food you love should NOT make you feel guilty!! It‚Äôs the holiday season, and we all deserve to indulge sometimes. If we beat ourselves up afterwards, it takes all of the fun away.  I‚Äôve been eating nonstop and I haven‚Äôt been working out as much, and yes, my pants feel way tighter than usual. But that is ok! Here is my advice: Eat your favorite foods when craving them and enjoy every bite. A few cheat meals won‚Äôt make or break your health, and guilt certainly won‚Äôt help either. Have fun, be thankful, move on, and know that it‚Äôs never too late to get back on track! PS. Follow my food account @idreamaboutfood üòú"
WOW - WE ARE OFFICIALLY 31 DAYS AWAY FROM 2020! WHAT?!? Always make a conscious choice to focus on YOU. Your growth, your dreams, your aspirations. I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, the greatest project you can ever work on is YOU. Whether you are trying to get in shape, lose weight, gain weight, become a doctor, become a yoga teacher, the key is to stay consistent and never give up. Push yourself to do the things you always wanted to do but claim you never had time for. Remember, it‚Äôs not about having time, it‚Äôs about making time. Make time for YOU! Work on YOU and you will be your best self!

Today is #LatinaEqualPay Day, when Latinas "catch up" to what white, non-hispanic men were paid in 2018. The gap is widest for Latina workers, who on average earn only 54 cents for every $1 a man is paid. Meaning, they must work nearly two years to earn what white men earn in one year. This is unacceptable, and we need to act now. We work hard & we deserve equal pay! @phenomenal tee benefits @mujerxsrising, which protects the rights of migrant women.

Resumen de un fin de semana de 10‚ù£Ô∏è
Tener dos hijos ‚Äútan seguidos‚Äù a veces facilita todo y otras lo dificulta por dos! Estos d√≠as me acuerdo del a√±o pasado por estas fechas, cuando evit√°bamos salir a comer los dos solos con los ni√±os porque hac√≠amos de todo menos comer... Ahora, cada vez podemos hacer mas planes en los que los 4 disfrutamos al m√°ximo. Los miro jugando, ri√©ndose a carcajadas y mientras los grabo en video haciendo tonter√≠as, pienso ‚Äúqu√© suerte que son mios!‚Äù. Acto seguido, rega√±o a uno o salgo corriendo a por el otro, pero benditos esos segundos de felicidad m√°xima sin a√±adidos. Gracias a ellos, todo merece la pena‚ù£Ô∏è

Today on World Soil Day it‚Äôs worth remembering the lessons of the Coon Creek Watershed of Southwest Wisconsin. In 1930 this was the most eroded farmland in America. With the help of the newly formed Soil Erosion Service farmers changed. They adopted strip cropping on the contours, put in terraces and stopped farming the steep hills to let the trees come back. Ninety years later this area is the very picture of fertility. It was saved. We need to do this on more of the world‚Äôs farmland. And we can. Saving our soil is saving our future. #worldsoil #terraton #indigoag
Skye has a rugged beauty at Sligachan where the river roars through the old Thomas Telford bridge when storms drop torrents of rain on the surrounding Red and Black Cuillins. Myths and legends abound, one being that you‚Äôll have eternal beauty if you dunk your head in the river for seven seconds. (Probably worth trying.) #scotland #isleofskye #storm @hiddenscotland
Another view over the shores of Sanday of the ongoing ‚Äúargument‚Äù between the sea and the sands that defines the character of these a North Sea islands. The farm at Overbister is caught in the middle of this geological bickering, wondering when the tides or a winter storm will choose to remake the coastline once again. Really hard to say what it looked like when the Vikings came, let alone when the Neolithic people started farming here 6,000 years ago. #scotland #orkney #visitorkney
Flying over Sanday you can see how dynamic the islands of Orkney truly are, constantly building dunes on one side while beaches are carving into farmland on the other. Here the sea has made a large incursion, breaking into the interior to create a tidal bay at Overbister. (Wonder how the farmer felt when this happened?) ‚ÄúBister‚Äù is old Norse for a farm. #scotland #visitorkney
Some places on the Isle of Harris have a moonscape look to them. But one hardly needs to invoke romance, the plain facts are evocative enough. To wit, I‚Äôll just quote from Wikipedia: ‚ÄúThe east coast of south Harris is known as the Bays. The best known section called the "Golden Road" as it cost so much money to build, when it was built in 1897. It runs from Miavaig via Drinishader, Grosebay, Scadabay and Cluer to Stockinish. From Stockinish the road is the Bays and meanders through the coastal townships of Lickisto (Liceasto), Geocrab (Ge√≤crab), Manish (M√†nais), Flodabay (Fle√≤ideabhagh), Ardvay (√Äird Mhighe), Finsbay (Fionnsbhagh) and Lingerbay (Lingreabhagh).‚Äù Such place-names. #scotland
Some chance encounters illuminate a place, make it human and join it to the stream of history. So it was for me when I met sheepherder Allan Gray gathering his sheep near the ruins of historic Kilchurn Castle on Loch Awe. There beneath the ruined walls (sent into permanent decline by a ferocious lightning bolt) Allan told me simple, personal stories, of the neighborhood, of his sheepdog (lurking just outside the frame, keeping the sheep at attention) and of the dog‚Äôs grandfather, who had been brilliant in ways that only come along every few generations, if ever in one person‚Äôs lifetime. Then the moment passed and I have not seen him again. #scotland #dogs
Granite boulders forming the Street of the Dead (Sraid nam Marbh) have lain here on Iona for more than 1,000 years. Along this processional way the bodies of Scottish Kings and royalty were carried to their graves in Reilig Odhr√°in from Martyr‚Äôs Bay, where Viking raiders killed 68 monks in 806 AD. (Plunder followed.) This small island holds that contradiction: a place of peace with a violent history.  #scotland  #iona
If I was a kid and somebody took me out on the little stone quay that pokes out into Loch Oich at the Glengarry Castle Hotel I‚Äôd probably think the world is pretty cool. #scotland
Loch Oich always seems a bit more mysterious than its neighbors on either side, Loch Ness and Loch Lochy. Perfect for a ramshackle boat tucked into a cove, no one seen, never moved. Not far away is the Well of the Seven Heads, a fine monument to the murderous revenge visited upon these shores in 1663 by Bald Iain. (Washed seven severed heads in the Loch, he did.) Pretty place. #scotland
Ousdale Broch is a gem, looking wild and overgrown on this hillside in Caithness, which has over 200 of these  2,000 year old tower houses!  The farmers and herders living here then had quite the view. A child growing up here lived in a world made lively with myths and legends. My guides were Kenneth and Iain from the Caithness Broch Project. These folks want to build a brand new broch. Follow @caithnessbrochproject to keep up on their progress. #scotland  #caithness
The moon and stars were aligned for me at the Stones of Stenness this summer. With just two days in Orkney I was delighted to discover that the full moon would be rising over the stones on the second night. Clouds that had obscured the moonrise eventually gave way to this scene, my reward on a beautiful evening. A car went by leaving the red trail of its taillights and I ran around lighting the stones with my little flashlight to complete the scene. #scotland #orkney #visitorkney

Maastricht was in so many ways a surprise to me: a beautiful old town with lots of retail, friendly people and wonderful food. And then, completely unexpected, the fog came! I have never experienced anything like this before: after a clear morning, fog starts to spread around noon. Amazing! Probably this only happens #InLimburg.

The Dominicanen is a unique bookstore. It was opened in the ancient Dominicanenkerk (Dominican church) in #Maastricht. Two hundred years ago, the church lost its sacred function and was used since then e.g. as a reptile house, a bicycle storage, and a ‚Äòcarnival temple‚Äô. CNN says @boekhandel_dominicanen is the most beautiful bookstore in the world. In any case, it is one of the most beautiful bookstores for me. 
The building also houses a caf√©. Besides books, there are also records and CDs. When did you buy your last CD?

The most wonderful time of the year ‚ú®
I've been thinking a lot lately about how grateful I am for all of YOU and the support and encouragement you've shown to our family and our business over these last few years. When I was blogging years ago to an audience of about 17 people, I would have never dreamed of any of this. You all are truly so kind, big hearted and the most supportive. We wouldn't be here without you. ‚ù§Ô∏è#thankful
In all the craziness this time of year can bring, our @magnolia team wanted to be really intentional about taking care of each other this season. So starting today and ending Dec. 2, we're going to give 25% of every online purchase you make to the Magnolia Foundation in support of organizations helping end youth homelessness. I hope you‚Äôll join us! Learn more at magnolia.com. #makeKINDNESSloud
"For years I've wanted to write down my mom's full holiday meal that she has made since I was little. It has always been hard for her to just give me the recipe because she cooks ""to taste"" so nothing is ever written down or measured. She just wings it every time and every time it's my favorite. So I cleared my schedule and sat and watched her every move and wrote it all down. It feels like such a gift to finally have these recipes of my mom‚Äôs on paper, all written out. And the even greater gift was the time we got to spend together in the kitchen today.
This thanksgiving, I'm extra grateful for family, tradition, and good food ‚ù§Ô∏è#HappyThanksgiving"
'Tis the season ‚ù§Ô∏è
This winter Hearth and Hand with Magnolia collection embraces all the nostalgia I love about the holidays. It's out now in stores and online @target! #HearthandHand
She was determined to make up her own cookie recipe and I left the kitchen so she could surprise me (and so i wouldn't micromanage her work in the kitchenüòÖ). Let's just say this was one of my favorite cookies I've ever tasted! It was like a perfect blend of a shortbread cookie and chocolate chip cookie topped with a yummy icing. I also love what she named them in her little cookbook, "Emmie Kay's chocolate chip kisses cookie" ‚ù§Ô∏è
"It's a beautiful day indeed! A few weeks ago we got to join the Magnolia team for an early screening of this new movie and it struck a chord with all of us. I really loved this movie and can't wait to watch it again. ‚†Ä
I watched Mister Rogers when I was younger and admired him when he was alive, and I love that his legacy of kindness and compassion is even stronger today. I think we could all be encouraged and inspired on how to #makeKINDNESSloud from him. Grab your family and friends and go see it Nov. 22! #ABeautifulDayMovie"

If you asked me a couple of years ago that I‚Äôd be singing and acting on stage in the west end I wouldn‚Äôt have believed it. Something like this would usually terrify me, and it definitely did. Many times I thought ‚Äúwhat am I doing? I‚Äôm so out my depth here‚Äù and got the classic ‚Äòimposter syndrome‚Äô which a lot of youtubers get whenever they branch out into anything outside of the internet. But this show and this experience really has been a game changer for me on so many different levels. Ive always said from day one that I‚Äôve just been riding a wave of luck for the last 8 or so years and I‚Äôm so excited to see where this wave will take me next. Best bit about it all is the continued support from friends, family and the people that have stumbled upon my channels etc and decided to stick around. I appreciate ya all more than you know.

Protect Pacific walruses like Dozer @seaworldsandiego by taking steps to reduce your carbon footprint. Historically, the greatest threat to this species was commercial hunting. Today, this threat has been replaced with the loss of stable sea ice due to climate change. Walruses feed on the ocean floor in the relatively shallow waters of the continental shelf, where the sea ice sustains a rich food web. Sea ice is also a resting place for this species in between meals, and females will often leave their young on this frozen platform while they forage. Without the sea ice, walruses must swim longer distances to find food and a place to rest, which means burning through hard-earned energy stores that the walrus needs to survive. Warming conditions also mean more water vessels are able to venture into remote ecosystems that were once inaccessible, increasing the likelihood of boat strikes, water contamination, and entanglement in marine debris. By opting to walk, bike, carpool, or use public transport you reduce your transportation emissions which helps to slow the progression of global warming, protecting the homes of walruses and many other species. #walrus #pacificwalrus #bigtusks #climatechange #globalwarming #gogreen #greentransportation #WalrusAwarenessWeek #PhotoArk #savetogether
Despite the least bittern‚Äôs impressively long neck, this bird is actually one of the smallest members of the heron family. Five subspecies of least bittern can be found in brackish and freshwater marshes from as far north as Canada, all the way south to Argentina. These birds are wetland-based carnivores, feeding on small fish, frogs, salamanders, slugs, crayfish, and a variety of insects. Least bitterns will usually stand at the base of aquatic plants near the surface of the water and patiently wait for their prey to appear. Once in sight, the bird easily collects small animals from the water using its long, thin bill. Draining of wetlands and the introduction of invasive species of plants are the greatest threats for the survival of this species in the wild. @wrcmn, where this bird was photographed was founded at the University of Minnesota in 1979, and has quickly grown into one of the busiest wildlife hospitals in the US. Each year, the WRC will admit close to 15,000 patients, providing life-saving care to more than 192 different species. #leastbittern #heron #bird #longneck #stripes #bigbeak #wetland #marshes #PhotoArk #savetogether
This adorable toad is a plains spadefoot @unlincoln. Wondering how this species got its name? Each of these toads has hard, keratinous protrusions on their hind feet which allows them to efficiently dig backwards into the soil, much like a spade (digging tool) with a very similar function. These digging skills are super handy as spadefoot toads spend much of their time underground in burrows they must dig for themselves. In the wild, this species covers a wide range, from western Canada into the northwestern US, and further down south to Texas and northern Mexico. No major threats are known, though the species has been negatively affected by intensive urbanization and agricultural development. These toads are especially susceptible to vehicle collisions as populations attempt to move between breeding (usually temporary pools of water) and non-breeding habitats. Always keep an eye out for amphibians when driving in your neighborhood, especially after it rains - you never know who might be visiting those roadside puddles! #spadefoottoad #plainsspadefoot #WorldSoilDay #digger #amphibian #bigeyes #smile #toad #PhotoArk #savetogether
This southern vested tamandua @zootampa looks like he‚Äôs ready to dance, standing perfectly poised on his hind legs with arms outstretched. Tamanduas live throughout much of South America, and while they can be found in savannas, tropical rainforests, scrub forests, and mangroves, they most commonly occur near streams and rivers. Tamanduas mostly eat ants and termites, using their forelimbs and claws to dig up insect nests, though they also eat honey and bees. While the mouth opening at the end of their elongated snout is only about the width of a pencil eraser, their tongues can be nearly 16 inches long - perfect for slurping up tasty insects. Tamanduas are a toothless species, but have a muscular gizzard in the stomach to help them digest their food. When they are not active, tamanduas will take shelter in tree hollows. You can help protect this incredible species by avoiding animal skin products when you shop, even those marked as ‚Äúfaux‚Äù to ensure you are not contributing to the illegal hunting of this species. In certain regions, tamanduas are hunted for meat, or even for their skins, which can be made into leather products. #tamandua #vested #dancer #longtongue #claws #longsnout #cute #bigears #furry #shopsmart #PhotoArk #savetogether
A hen Indochinese green peafowl strikes a pose for the camera during a photoshoot @accb_cambodia. Also known as dragonbird, the green peafowl is a powerful flyer, capable of covering long distances as they travel from their nesting sites deep in the forest to feeding sites in marsh pastures along riverbanks. Their diet consists mainly of seeds, insects, reptiles, fruits and small animals, and is also known for hunting venomous snakes. The Angkor Center for Conservation of Biodiversity, where this photo was taken, aims to rescue and care for native Cambodian wildlife, rehabilitating species in their care with the goal of one day releasing these individuals back into the wild. #peafowl #greenpeafowl #Indochinese #hen #colorful #dragonbird #ACCB #PhotoArk #savetogether
This cute fellow is a golden Asian mantis at the Albuquerque BioPark (@oneabq). While many insects give people the creeps, mantids seem capable of winning the affections of almost everyone with their human-like heads and statuesque figures. Praying mantids earned their name because when they are waiting for prey, they fold their front legs in an upright position as if they are folded in prayer. While this species may look angelic, don‚Äôt be fooled - the mantid is a deadly predator. With the ability to swivel its head, there‚Äôs nothing the mantid can‚Äôt see, and once a bee or fly enters its line of sight, those forearms extend with lightning quick speed, instantly snatching up its prey. Some larger species of mantid can catch much bigger prey - lizards, frogs, and even birds! #goldenmantid #prayingmantis #predator #bigeyes #bugeyed #angelic #PhotoArk #savetogether

Happy Thanksgiving from this beautiful ocellated turkey @officialdwazoo! Endemic to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Guatemala and Belize, ocellated turkeys, especially males, look similar to the North American wild turkey, but have more vibrant coloring and weigh significantly less than the birds in the States. Males weigh just over ten pounds and average three feet in length, while females are slightly smaller in size. Both sexes have bluish-gray tails with a well-defined, eye-shaped, blue-bronze colored spot near the end followed by a bright gold tip. These spots give the ocellated turkey its name, as the Latin word for eye is oculus. In the wild, large scale timber operations and slash and burn agriculture in Central America threaten the habitat of the ocellated turkey. To combat this threat, and create a better future for the species, @rainforestalliance is working to advance community forestry, sustainable agriculture, ecotourism, and environmental education, supporting local landscapes and communities in areas where this bird is found. #Thanksgiving #TurkeyDay #ocellatedturkey #colorful #bird #PhotoArk #savetogether
"George Divoky at home with 45 years of first hand documentation of the Black Guillemots of Cooper Island. #friendsofcooperisland By don‚Äôt of his singlehanded study of these birds George has also amassed one the truly detailed, resoundingly provable accounts of global warming on the planet.

"In 2001, I did a story on a patient, tenacious, gregarious ornithologist named George Divoky, who had spent 28 years and counting, living on a forbidding stretch of ice north of Alaska, 3 months a year, studying his specialty, arctic seabirds. Inadvertently, what he also did was amass one of the world's largest experiential accounts of global warming. A lot of theoreticians who project climate change use algorithms, and scientifically based modeling to project the loss of the ice pack. By contrast, George has lived it, all these years, sleeping on the ice, living in solitary, difficult conditions, and making painstaking notes in old school, battered, salt stained notebooks. When I visited him, it was basically the two of us, stranded on the ice for nearly ten days, eating Dinty Moore beef stew and living in pup tents. You get to know each other in these conditions. George and I became friends and remain so to this day. 
His study is now at 45 years in duration, and I went back up to Cooper Island this past July of 2019, with a film crew, to document his ongoing research, which is an astonishing and important act of perseverance. I photographed George standing once again in the very same place I photographed him all those years ago. Back in 2001, he was standing on ice. Now, in 2019, he is knee deep in water. To quote George, ""The Arctic is melting."" He is seen here in his shack which is his home (and protection from polar bears) for the three months he lives on Cooper.

"Swipe ~ Like these two kind women in Bali at their home in Tenganan Village, last night I also made a Pengelukatan or a cleaning ceremony, by burning sage to cleanse the spirits on the first night in my new house, a 119 year-old home in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts. This morning I awoke to a beautiful sunrise through the kitchen window overlooking the Housatonic River. So thankful finally to have a home, in spiritual connection from Bali to the Berkshire...

"From my book, Island of the Spirits - This was a magical evening in Tibubeneng, the small village where for five years was my home in Bali. It was the eve of Nyepi, the day known as the Day of Silence. Giant effigies called Ogoh-Ogoh‚Äôs are paraded around the streets at night in every village throughout Bali as a purification of the natural environment, cleansing any spiritual pollutants emitted from the activities of living beings, especially humans‚Ä¶we sure are a messy lot. An Ogoh-Ogoh (pronounced ‚ÄúOoogo-Ooogo‚Äù) can be gigantic in size, taking weeks to create out of paper mache and bamboo. Many are so heavy it takes 20 or more strong people to carry! An entire gamelan orchestra is also in the procession as everyone in the village walks, until nearing midnight when the Ogoh-Ogoh is burned in a massive roar of fire. Then begins the most magical moment‚Ä¶Nyepi. At midnight, no one is allowed out of their homes. No one can speak, except in short whispers. No lights or electricity can be used, nor open flames for the next 24 hours‚Ä¶the international airport in Denpasar is the only airport on earth that literally closes down, accepting no incoming our outgoing flights for twenty-four hours. We all need a day of silence to meditate on our lives, a period of time to collect our thoughts and being. It is so quiet, peaceful during Nyepi, a time when we allow the earth and spirits to be with us, without light pollution or any other distraction other than silence.

It was  beautiful afternoon in Ubud during a royal cremation, a day-long event filled with ceremonial rituals. When the family carried the remains of Tjokorde Isteri Muter up the cremation tower, everything for a few moments became silent, its massiveness towering 30 meters or more to the sky. Moments later it was burned, carrying the spirit of Tjokorde into the afterlife. Death in Balinese Hinduism is a mixture of mourning, a celebration of life and the afterlife to come. When I die, and we all will, celebrate a life lived as I wish for each of you, in acts of creating, doing, in unconditional love for the purpose we are all here.

"My dear friend, Bli @wayantilik, brought me of a very rare ceremony that his family performs every five years‚Ä¶the purification of their land, to give thanks to a prayer that was granted years past. After the ceremony which included the sacrificing of a cow, Wayan‚Äôs relatives gathered at the temple in their rice field. I believe this was Wayan‚Äôs auntie carrying the pasepan (fire bowl) on her head as a symbol of Lord Brahma, worshipping him as a upasaksi (a witness) during a very sacred¬†Mapepada ceremony in Tabanan. This photograph always sticks with me and I‚Äôve never been able to understand why.

When home was Bali, I lived within the center of a rice field in Canggu. At the time we were the only foreigners amongst the kindest of neighbors. Sometimes within walking distance the photography in Island of the Spirits were just there, like at our local Hindu temple. A short motor-scooter ride from home was this beautiful ceremony after prayers to the spirits beside Batu Bolong Temple on Canggu Beach, the priests blessing all with water‚Ä¶this rock only appears during low tide. Today feels just right to share this peaceful photograph on a day of giving thanks in the country I now live. I don‚Äôt accept the idea of single days in specialness, like Valentines day or Thanksgiving day to mentioned a few. Everyday, like in Bali, should be one of giving thanks and love to each other. Happy day of giving thanks, to all‚Ä¶every day.

There was so much being offered, occurring, using this beauty of a slow giving Holga camera. It was the first spiritual event I attending when creating the Island of the Spirits. I went with my dear friend and assistant, Bli Wayan Tilik, to the Bali Aga village in Tenganan. This day was the Perang Pandan, an ancient ritual where young men in the village fight each other using thorny padan leaves. I had never witnessed a ceremony like this anywhere before‚Ä¶the boys would thrash themselves till bleeding to show their respect to Dewa Indra, the god of war. After this ceremony I began to realize the challenges of working with a Holga could be overcame, that this simple plastic film camera was the right means to see and give kindness to a culture so steeped in tradition, where little had changed in centuries.

This moment was so special, something I had never seen before‚Ä¶the high priestess or what is known in Balinese as the Ratu Pedanda, is held by her followers throughout the entire ritual she conducts during a cremation. She is called a living Siwa and is believed to deliver direct messages or requests from the gods. Never can she touch the ground, always carried in the most gentle kindness and respect.

"Holiday Print Sale, link in my IG bio - To have one foot in the past, another firmly in the present, I chose to use a Holga film camera for my book, Island of the Spirits. This unique beauty allowed the timeliness of a culture so deep in tradition to be raw, real and truthful. The Holga speaks in this ephemeral nature how time is not really real. There were challenges using a Holga‚Ä¶light leaks, only 12 frames per roll, the slow methodology in changing film, all in movement of near meditation. When spiritual events like this man, deep in trance trying to stab himself during the cleansing ritual known as, Melasti, everything moved so quickly. There was only the ability to make one photograph, knowing that all the history before, all the history to come, would never repeat. I‚Äôve witnessed numerous Melasti‚Äôs while living in Bali and never have I seen anyone draw blood or hurt themselves, no matter how hard the pointed Kirs (a dagger-like sword) was pushed into skin. This protection, I am told, was due to the deep belief and faith that the spirits would protect those fortunate enough to receive such a heightened level of spirituality.

"Saya ikut memperingati Hari Antikorupsi Sedunia yang jatuh hari ini, 9 Desember 2019, dengan menyaksikan sebuah pentas sederhana di SMKN 57 Jakarta. Drama ini tentang anak sekolah dan penjual bakso.

Seorang siswa hendak menggunakan uang pentas seni untuk jajan semangkuk bakso. Tapi ia bertemu penjual bakso yang bijak. Anak sekolah dinasehati untuk tak menyalahgunakan uang bersama kepentingan pribadi.

Drama bertajuk Prestasi Tanpa Korupsi itu membawa pesan sederhana bahwa perilaku korupsi, sekecil apa pun bentuknya ‚Äì korupsi uang, waktu, nepotisme, dan lain-lain -- tidak diperbolehkan.

Oh ya, para pemeran drama singkat tadi sungguh istimewa. Tahukah Anda siapa penjual bakso dan anak-anak sekolah di pentas itu?"
"Mari membiasakan diri dengan nilai-nilai integritas dan kejujuran semenjak dini. Jadikan sebagai budaya kerja dan budaya keseharian kita.

Hindari korupsi dari yang sekecil-kecilnya."
"Memenangkan kompetisi itu penting, sportivitas olahraga juga harus dijunjung tinggi, tapi kemanusiaan di atas segalanya.

Apresiasi saya untuk peselancar Filipina, Roger Casugay, yang merelakan kesempatan meraih medali emas demi menolong pesaingnya, atlet Indonesia Arip Nurhidayat yang terjatuh dalam lomba.

Salam hormat dari Indonesia."

"Panjangnya hanya 11 kilometer. Hanya ruas pendek di antara jalan tol lingkar luar Jakarta (JORR) II yang melingkar 110 kilometer antara Jakarta, Tangerang, Tangerang Selatan, Bogor, Depok, dan Bekasi. Akan tetapi, jalan tol ruas Kunciran-Serpong yang saya resmikan kemarin begitu penting.

Jalan tol ini menjadi jalur pengalihan sebagian kendaraan, terutama kendaraan berat, dari jalur jalan tol dalam kota Jakarta dan JORR I yang padat. Di jalur-jalur inilah, orang-orang yang bolak-balik Banten-Jakarta kerap mengeluh: ‚ÄúPak, kita ini bisa tua di jalan karena macet‚Äù. Waktu terbuang di jalan adalah sebuah kerugian yang besar karena menggerus daya saing kita dan pengeluaran biaya bahan bakar kendaraan.

Alhamdulillah, pembangunan jalan tol Kunciran-Serpong akhirnya rampung dan segera bisa kita manfaatkan.

JORR II terdiri atas enam ruas tol yang menghubungkan daerah Cengkareng, Kunciran, Serpong, Cinere, Jagorawi, Cimanggis, Cibitung, dan Cilincing. Sebagian besar akan selesai pada pertengahan tahun 2020."
"Bertemu dan berbincang sejenak dengan Ibu Inah, selepas santap siang di Kota Cilegon. Rupanya, Ibu Inah telah menunggu dan menyambangi lokasi kunjungan saya di Banten, dari sekitar helipad, lokasi peresmian pabrik, sampai di halaman masjid.

Akhirnya, keinginan Ibu Inah terwujud. Kami bersalaman dan berbincang di depan rumah makan. Semoga Ibu Inah dan putrinya senantiasa sehat dan sejahtera."
"Saya mengapresiasi investasi yang dilakukan PT Chandra Asri Petrochemical yang membangun pabrik baru di Kota Cilegon, Banten dan saya resmikan hari ini. Pabrik tersebut memproduksi polietilena, salah satu bahan baku produk pendukung infrastruktur dalam negeri.

PT Chandra Asri adalah pionir industri petrokimia di Tanah Air. Pabrik baru ini berkapasitas 400 ribu ton per tahun.

Akan tetapi, kebutuhan domestik polietilena sebagai bahan baku industri mencapai 2,3 juta ton per tahun, sementara kapasitas produksi nasional untuk bahan baku tersebut baru mencapai 780 ribu ton. Kita masih impor 1,52 juta ton.

Karena itulah saya berharap, investasi penanaman modal di bidang ini harus terus diberi ruang.  Kalau kita bisa membuat sendiri kenapa harus impor?

Selain itu, investasi industri seperti ini membuka lapangan kerja yang besar, yang berkontribusi menggerakkan roda ekonomi, tidak hanya di Cilegon dan Banten saja, tetapi juga perekonomian nasional kita."
"Setiba di Banten pagi ini, saya langsung ke RSUD Cilegon. Seperti sebelumnya di Lampung dan Subang, saya meninjau pelayanan BPJS Kesehatan. Terutama, hendak memastikan apakah yang berada di kelas III itu peserta BPJS.

Dan benar, angkanya sama: sebagian besar pasien yang datang berobat ditanggung BPJS. Sejauh ini, saya juga belum mendengar keluhan langsung pelayanan di tiga rumah sakit yang saya datangi tersebut.

Tentu saja masih banyak rumah sakit kita yang fasilitasnya perlu diperbaiki. Tapi itu tugas pemerintah daerah. Tugas pemerintah kota, pemerintah kabupaten, pemerintah provinsi sebagai pemilik hampir semua rumah sakit umum."
"Dari Pangkalan TNI AU Atang Sanjaya, Kabupaten Bogor, pagi ini, saya bertolak menuju Provinsi Banten dengan helikopter. Kunjungan hanya sehari tapi dengan beragam acara, dari meresmikan pabrik new polyethylene, meninjau Program Membina Ekonomi Keluarga Sejahtera (Mekaar), sampai meresmikan jalan tol JORR II ruas Kunciran-Serpong.

Selamat pagi."
Terima kasih. Ini kehormatan bukan untuk saya semata-mata, tapi untuk Indonesia.
"Rapat terbatas di Jakarta sore tadi, membahas pengelolaan cadangan beras pemerintah. Saya meminta manajemen pengelolaan cadangan beras segera dibenahi sehingga penumpukan stok beras yang tidak tersalurkan dapat ditangani, dan dicarikan jalan keluarnya sejak jauh hari.

Penumpukan tersebut meningkatkan biaya perawatan, juga dapat menurunkan mutu dari stok beras yang ada.

Selain itu, kepada jajaran terkait, saya mengharapkan data produksi beras yang betul-betul riil dan terkonsolidasi sehingga kita memiliki pegangan data yang kuat sebelum mengambil keputusan.

Produksi beras di setiap daerah tidaklah merata, ada yang berlebih dan mampu memasok ke luar daerahnya, ada pula yang membutuhkan pasokan beras dari luar wilayahnya. Jadi, selain urusan ketersediaan komoditas beras, manajemen logistik dan rantai pasok beras nasional juga perlu dibenahi."

"I‚Äôm excited to share a few photos from one of the most special places I‚Äôve ever traveled to or photographed: The ancient archeological site of Hegra (also known as Mada‚ÄôIn Saleh). I was fortunate enough to visit this site on my recent assignment in Saudi Arabia, and it absolutely blew me away. This amazing site constitutes the southernmost settlement of the Nabatean Kingdom, dating back to the 1st century AD. This is the same kingdom that built Petra (in modern-day Jordan) further to the north. However, this is far more expansive than Petra, and without the crowds. Designated in 2008 as a site of patrimony, this is Saudi Arabia‚Äôs first UNESCO world heritage site. The real jaw-dropping sights here are the elaborately cut rock tombs with their ornamental facades. The richer you were, the more elaborate tomb you could afford. Some, like this one called Al Farid, are incredible ornate and beautiful, especially when cut from a single freestanding rock in the desert. It was truly an honor to visit this special place. An important note: the site is currently closed for archeological excavation, and will reopen in October of 2020. Put it on your bucket list! 
#experiencealula #onassignment"
Approximately 25 miles northwest of the Turkish city of Antalya lies one of the greatest archeological ruins I‚Äôve ever laid my eyes on: Termessos. Alexander the Great, who didn‚Äôt bother to try to invade this strategically located city, once called Termessos the ‚ÄúEagles Nest‚Äù due to its precipitous perch 3000 feet high on top of a mountain. To walk through this ancient city now is a walk through time, full of ruined buildings, woodlands overtaking the fallen stones, and birds chirping in the crisp mountain air. The pathways, houses, and gathering places literally come to life as you wander through the scattered stones. The highlight of a visit to Termessos is, without a doubt, this incredibly preserved 4500 capacity Roman theatre. Can you imagine the views the spectators had while plays and orations were taking place in the round theatre below? Absolutely breathtaking. Although it is a bit of a trek to get here, and it is not necessarily on the tourist route, I‚Äôd highly recommend a stop here if/when you visit Turkey.
#sponsored I'm headed back to Africa soon and I am stoked to have picked up a new pair of Canon 10X20 IS Binoculars for close-up animal viewing on safari. I started out my photography career shooting @CanonUSA and have always been impressed by the sharpness and clarity of their optics. So it would make sense that those same high quality optics translate into these lightweight binoculars. And the best part is that they have built-in Image Stabilization...all the better to see you with, my dear. When bumping down those dirt roads on the lookout for big game, these will be invaluable.

"I recently had the incredible honor to attend the Royal Inaugural ceremony of a new UNESCO World heritage sight, Diriyah Gate, located just outside of the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The conservation and preservation of our collective world heritage sites is important to me, and are reasons to honor and celebrate our past. And this site definitely deserves its Heritage status. Established in 1466 AD on the banks of the Wadi Hanifa oasis, this mud-brick city became the capital of the first Saudi state in 1744 AD. Once open only to the Royal family, the designation of this new UNESCO site opens up this beautiful architecture for anyone who would like to walk through its labyrinth of rooms and learn about its fascinating history. But there‚Äôs more to this site than meets the eye. It also represents a new wave of openness and change for the kingdom. To me, the changes that are happening in Saudi Arabia are just as interesting as its historical landmarks. Stay tuned for more thoughts on my visit to what I felt was a special and amazing place...the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

"Closely related to the Blue Jay of the eastern North America states, the Steller‚Äôs Jay is a distinctive bird native to western North America. I grew up watching Blue Jays in our backyard feeder, and I could instinctively see that this bird was different. But it still had the bossy, noisy, crow-like tendencies that I saw in the blue jays of my youth. I had been hoping that I could find a moment where the beautiful dark blue of the Steller Jay could be contrasted with the yellow Aspen trees as the quick moving bird rested for a few seconds on a branch. Sometimes, with enough patience, you get lucky. As a photographer, it can be a huge asset to know color theory..which colors complement/contrast well with others. Blue is on the opposite quadrant of the color wheel as yellow, and can make for an instinctively pleasing contrast. Do you think about color theory in your photography?

"We wait so long to catch a glimpse of the few weeks that the trees put on their magnificent displays of yellows, oranges, and reds. And when it happens it is an absolutely glorious thing. Like most of the best things in life, it never lasts as long as you want. As a photographer trying to capture this special time of year, the initial excitement and overwhelming elation to the absolute beauty in every direction eventually turns to finding the really special moments of light. It was here, where the light on the aspens played and danced with the shadows below, that I started to find the compositions that touched my soul. This was one of them.

"Most people visit Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska to see the massive grizzly bears feasting on the salmon run. Yeah, we saw that too, and I‚Äôll share some photos soon. But we also saw lots of other beautiful animals, such as this curious young wolf. We had heard that he was snooping around and eating leftover salmon bits early mornings along the riverbank and so we decided to get up super early to see if we could catch a glimpse. Not only did we see him that first day, but every morning thereafter. You had to get up before the birds...around 5:00 am...to catch a glimpse of him, as he didn‚Äôt stay around a long time. But the lack of sleep was totally worth spending a few precious moments with this magnificent creature. And he even got brave enough to venture close and lock eyes with the strange creatures watching him. Any day you get to see a wolf in the wild is a good day.

If I thought giving birth was the hardest thing a woman had to go through in her life then I was wrong! Separating a woman from her baby is a million times harder.
I thank every day that we have been blessed with a job we enjoy and make millions of people happy with us, but the work requires us to travel quite a bit, which means we have to leave Ariel in the hands of her loving grandmothers.
Maya is a true hero the way she flies off for work every time despite the difficulty in parting from Ariel and manages to put her future ahead of her own personal struggle. She keeps saying that separating from Ariel is the hardest thing she's ever experienced, and it doesn't get easier from time to time, even though it makes sense it will. So, there is no sense in parenting... Only what the heart feels.
Being a career person while raising a family is perhaps one of the most difficult challenges we would have to face in life. I don't know what we would do without both of our amazing mothers. I guess mother love to her child has no expiration date.

I discovered @livelarq last year when I was Christmas shopping. I ended up buying everyone in my family one (instead of a bunch of stocking stuffers, we had everyone pick one gift to get each person). If you're like me, then you probably have a water bottle on you at all times. I made it a part of my routine a few years ago and it's dramatically changed how much I drink water, which has been incredibly helpful while pregnant and now breastfeeding. BUT I'm pretty sure it's everyone's goal to drink more water in a day. I love @livelarq for more than just being a water bottle though...1) they have a purification system built in that uses UV light to kill 99.9999% of bacteria and viruses 2) they're double insulated so they keep cold water cold and hot drinks hot 3) they come in really cute colors so they attractive to look at 4) they make the perfect gifts! I've been using mine for over a year now and I'm giving them a full review over on galmeetsglam.com  today #drinkbrilliantly #sponsored

Figuring out how to crack a song with guys like @anderson._paak, @ludwiggoransson and @jamesfauntleroyii is really why I got into this in the first place. Literally nothing better. Wanted to give you guys a glimpse of the whole process before it all comes out, so here you go... I‚Äôm excited to say there‚Äôs A LOT more where this came from üôå

Por ah√≠ dicen que si no hablas Dios no te escucha pero yo creo que m√°s bien NADIE te escucha. Es importante decir lo que piensas y lo que quieres para ser lo m√°s claro posible, nada sucede m√°gicamente, as√≠ que si quieres que algo suceda comun√≠calo, la comunicaci√≥n es la herramienta b√°sica y principal de los humanos. Eso si, hay que intentar ser lo m√°s asertivos posibles, ya si por m√°s que intentas comunicarte no le entra a la otra persona ya no queda en ti, porque tambi√©n hay gente que no est√° abierta a escuchar. üì∑ @busheadoph
"Desgraciadamente las mujeres nos hacemos ilusiones influenciadas por pel√≠culas, historias, ideas de otros, etc... sobre c√≥mo deber√≠an de ser las relaciones y c√≥mo deber√≠an de accionar los hombres ante ciertas situaciones. Tenemos una fantas√≠a en la cabeza de que cuando la cagan hagan algo al respecto para remediarlo, proyectamos en nuestra mente a esa persona afuera de nuestra casa con flores y mariachi pidiendo disculpas, o cualquier otra proyecci√≥n donde esperamos una demostraci√≥n de amor que nunca va a suceder. Eso no existe, es una ilusi√≥n en la que vivimos, claro, seguro existe por ah√≠ alguna excepci√≥n que como en las pel√≠culas corre al aeropuerto a decirte cu√°nto te ama y que te quedes con √©l, pero en general esas cosas solo suceden en nuestra imaginaci√≥n. Queremos que se pongan las pilas cuando esas pilas ya est√°n puestas pero no funcionan como t√∫ esperas. La realidad es otra, es lo que hay, es lo que pasa en el momento presente y si no pasa nada es porque nada es lo que hay. 
Mujeres, aterricemos nuestra mente en la tierra y no en el cielo, engrandecemos lo que no es grande, idealizamos lo que no es, le pedimos peras al manzano y as√≠ la vida nunca te va a satisfacer. üì∑ @evertdnieves"

Me encontr√© con varias Yoss pero al final solo existe una."
"En este retiro te hablan de verte al espejo, todo lo que ves afuera es un reflejo de lo que traes adentro, las cosas que no te gustan que est√°n en tu entorno son responsabilidad tuya y de nadie m√°s. ¬øCu√°nto hay que aguantar y esperar para darte cuenta que el problema no son los dem√°s sino t√∫?

"Caminando mi vida me he descubierto en un terreno distinto, un lugar que eleg√≠ y me siento en armon√≠a.

He encontrado un camino que me lleva a seguir entendiendo a los dem√°s pero me da el permiso de entender(me) cuando decido alejar a aquellas personas que no me permiten estar en equilibrio.

Ya no le huyo a el sufrimiento, m√°s bien le abro la puerta, le permito estar el tiempo que necesite y lo despido sin rencor.

En los momentos de tristeza busco en medio de las l√°grimas la lecci√≥n, las seco y sigo caminando hac√≠a la siguiente experiencia.

Las experiencias me han hecho avanzar pero ya no me cambian. Ya no.

"[Aisha Baker Take-Over] Today my Instagram is being taken over by Aisha Baker @aishabakerjewelry, launching their new collection ‚ÄòFrozen in Time‚Äô. This collection, adorned with the peony, a powerful symbol of happiness, is an expression of joy. An expression of happiness as the ultimate reward for the epic tale. A beautiful moment, frozen in time. .
For hundreds centuries, the humble peony has been imbued with great aspirations as a symbol of happiness, wealth and success. The  Peony Symphony brings brilliant new life to an ancient symbol. A beautiful, flowering plant in deep icy blue, frozen in transparent quartz. .

"[Margot McKinney Take-Over] I @margotmckinney am excited to be ‚Äútaking over‚Äù my friend, Katerina‚Äôs Instagram today!! What a treat to be sharing my creations with all of Katerina‚Äôs devoted followers. Such an appreciative audience for rare and unique gems including this extraordinary 119.44ct Aquamarine - one of the finest gems of its type and one of the finest I have ever had the pleasure of working with. It is breathtakingly beautiful - blue as if you could dive into it, and as sparklingly bright as an Aquamarine can be. Nature is magnificent. The pendant is detachable from these Australian South Sea pearls and can be worn on a simple gold chain for a completely different look.

"[Margot McKinney Take-Over] When my great friend, Katerina asked me if I @margotmckinney would like to ‚Äútake over‚Äù her Instagram account for the day I went into a panic! How would I ever choose just three jewels to post - what a decision!! One piece I chose is this superb Aquamarine and Diamond ring. I adore Aquamarines - there is something alluring and calming about them. Aquamarine‚Äôs name comes from the Latin for seawater and it was said to calm waves and keep sailors safe at sea. March‚Äôs birthstone was also thought to enhance the happiness of marriages. Like Emerald, Aquamarine is a member of the Beryl family and is often found in large crystals which can be cut into beautiful large gemstones - my absolute favorite!!

"[LALAoUNIS Take-Over] The final pieces I, Maria Lalaouni @iliaslalaounis, have chosen to share with you today are very festive. They have a lace-like effect and are inspired by a metalworking technique used in jewellery from the 3rd century AD until the Byzantine era called opus interrasile. Both pieces are articulated and playful and have a textured gold surface sprinkled throughout with diamonds. They are part of our Aurelia collection, which means ‚Äòthe golden one‚Äô. Wether I am wearing a small ring with symbolic references or an impressive pair of earrings, it always makes me feel special. Jewellery has a feel good factor. What we chose to wear expresses our individuality, complements our beauty and like in our ancestors' times also at times empowers us. Thank you Katerina for inviting us to share your Instagram with your followers. From all of us at LALAoUNIS we send you all our very best wishes for a Golden year!!!

"[LALAoUNIS Take-Over] At @iliaslalaounis we find Inspiration all around us. Wether walking through the narrow streets in the old part of Athens, surrounded by antiquities and looking up at The Acropolis, strolling on a sandy beach, visiting a museum or leafing through a beautiful book, one can't resist but translate what captures one's imagination. These Epirus chandelier earrings and flower cluster ring in 18k gold with satin finish and embellished with diamonds, are inspired by traditional dresses from the North of Greece, their belts and accessories. Real treasures from which one can draw endless inspiration. .

10 months ago we started the journey of @cursed, and very quickly it became apparent that this story was much greater than any one of us had imagined. It‚Äôs been the most empowering feeling getting to go to work every day and tell the story of a true heroine; capable and strong, but especially to tell it with so many other women at the helm - from executive producers, directors, heads of hair and make up, head of costume, head of art department, head armourer, script supervisor, stunts, grips, camera, video, daily team Nim....it reinforced how important having your story told truthfully is, especially as a woman. I hope when this comes out that it gives you the power to thrive to the fullest, like it‚Äôs given all of us this past year. ‚öîÔ∏è #thatsawrap  #shoutouttotheladies
World mental health day üíô You all know mental health is a topic very close to my heart. Every day, I get comments and messages from people all around the world talking about their experiences and what they‚Äôre going through, and for me - hearing your stories is one of the greatest gifts of what I get to do. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of social media in it‚Äôs entirety (as you also know), but what I do love is that it‚Äôs a place where we can all be brought together. Not just today, but every day I‚Äôm wishing you every ounce of love, and want to remind you that even if you don‚Äôt feel supported in the community that you live in now, you have a community here. #worldsmentalhealthday

"@YSLBeauty recently sent me a very interesting kit ‚Äì vinyl player and a record with a track and manifesto of freedom from Dua Lipa and LIBRE fragrance. Great idea and execution ‚Äì the perfume itself is an outstanding creation, it‚Äôs a fusion of contradictions. The clash of coolness and sexuality. Anne Flipo took the provocative step of combining men's perfume traditions in a women's fragrance ‚Äì just as Yves Saint Laurent once reimagined a tuxedo and turned it into a woman's costume.
Brilliant and relevant. The fragrance became new shade of my freedom

Their area covers thousands of hectares and some of them are more than 1000 years old. #Tegallalang rice fields would bring the ordinary city dweller the indescribable delight! They are located at an altitude of 800 m above sea level, in a river valley. It‚Äôs one of the oldest and most visited attractions on the island. Highly recommend))

After getting back from Iran I took The Rub√°iy√°t of Omar Khayy√°m which we kept in our family from the times of USSR and one of the first I saw there was this wisdom which described my impressions of the trip to this beautiful country so perfectly

"Iran has become that true oriental fairy tale that we have been looking for a long time. Magnificent ornaments of glass and mosaics can be found here everywhere and the technology of their production is carefully stored and passed from generation to generation. Iranian style in interior is first of all comfort, warmth and tranquility. Here you feel like at home, and home, as you know, is the place where you want to come back again and again

"The name ‚Äòtraditional Iranian house‚Äô usually means nothing to a person who has never been to Iran. Frankly speaking, I was also confused ‚Äì these houses don‚Äôt have usual stars, like hotels, and to understand what awaits you there when you came to the country is really difficult.
The reality is that such houses are built only by a very wealthy owners for whom high level of service are not just words. Houses usually have a spacious yard, green garden and, necessarily, a pool in the center where a couple of watermelons usually float!Architectural solutions of traditional houses have almost no analogues in the world and allow to have perfect natural ‚Äòclimate control‚Äô. At summer, even in extreme heat, the lower part is always cool so it‚Äôs even possible to store fruits and vegetables there! And in the evenings guests are always welcome to have a cup of tea or coffee accompanied by the owners near the fountain with gold fishes!

"Borujerdi house is one of the best examples of the atmosphere of luxury that prevailed in Kashan in the 19th century. The merchant from wealth family Seyyed Mehdi decided to surprise the family of his future wife and for 18 years spent time on construction of this, perhaps, one of the most beautiful houses in the city. In 2014, Borujerdi House was nominated one of the best historical houses in Asia, and in 2015 - received the status of UNESCO Top Choice in Iran. Some often compare it to the houses designed by Gaudi in Barcelona

"‚ÄúCan you work out on an empty stomach?‚Äù ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£This is a question I get a lot from the #BBGcommunity, and what I've noticed with my clients that everyone is different! For me, I feel sick if I do a high intensity workout on an empty stomach. Also, in the morning I usually wake up hungry, so the first thing I want to do is eat, not train. I want to make sure that I have enough fuel, or food, in my body to be able to work out.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
BEFORE my bootcamp on Saturday (which was at 2pm) I ate as normal, so for breakfast I had toast with spinach, mushrooms and avocado and then lunch was sushi. I also snacked on fruit a couple of hours before my bootcamp started because I wanted to make sure I had enough fuel to smash it! ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Some women find they can work out on an empty stomach first thing in the morning and they feel fine, but for others, working out on an empty stomach might make them feel ill or like they‚Äôre not actually performing at their best. For anyone who plans to work out later in the day or the afternoon, I would always suggest you eat your meals and snacks as normal too. However if you‚Äôre a morning person that wants to work out before breakfast, then that‚Äôs okay too. If you work out after work or in the evening, I would always suggest you wait one-and-a-half hours after eating before you train. The main thing to consider is what feels right for YOU and YOUR body. There's nothing worse than finishing a workout and feeling unwell, so do what makes you feel happy, confident and strong! üòÅüí™üèª"
What an incredible trip!!! I‚Äôve been away for almost a whole month in New York, Sydney and Dubai and it‚Äôs been amazing to revisit some of my favourite cities! I feel so lucky to that @tobi_pearce and I have been able to travel with Arna and show her the world - it just makes me want to explore more places with her and introduce her to new countries and different cultures. Even though I absolutely love travelling, there is nothing like that feeling of coming home, especially to see my sweet baby girl. I CANNOT wait to see her again! Being away from her these last few days has been SO hard but I know she‚Äôs being cuddled by someone in my family literally every second she‚Äôs awake lol. üòÇ It has been the most amazing month of connecting with the #BBGcommunity as well - thank you so much to everyone for your support, especially for my IGTV series, Begin Again. I was so nervous about getting out of my comfort zone and being vulnerable, but the comments and messages you have sent have made me realise just how lucky I am to be part of this community of women from around the world. You all make me feel so grateful and SO proud! üôåüèºüí™üèº PS there is a new episode of Begin Again coming out tomorrow and I promise that it will seriously inspire you - STAY TUNED!!! üì∫
To be honest, I was actually SO nervous about my Dubai Active bootcamp. In the weeks leading up to it I felt as though people would be wondering if I can actually do everything I say I can do. The incredible thing was that when it came time to start, I felt nothing but encouragement from you ladies - there was SO much excitement in the room and you made any nerves I had completely disappear. Thank you so much to everyone who was there, you KILLED IT! I‚Äôm SO ready for another bootcamp now - where should I go next? Comment below!
"LOL @leahitsines, is this actually us? üòÇ Seriously, even though we facetime 100 times a day I am actually missing my sister, my family, @tobi_pearce and Arna SO much. If I could take my entire family with me when I travel, I honestly would. When I'm home, I visit Yiayia and Papou in the morning and we eat dinner as a family every night, so I get REALLY home sick for this while I'm away. But guess what...? I am coming HOME!!! See you soon Adelaide!! üòÉ

"YUUSSS!! I cannot believe what an amazing experience that was!!Dubai Active Show BOOTCAMP is something I will always remember!
It was my FIRST bootcamp since becoming pregnant and having Arna and everyone made me feel SO welcome the second I stepped on to the stage. The energy in the room was INCREDIBLE and I felt SO supported. I am so PROUD of everyone who pushed themselves to do a workout with me!! Thankyou Dubai üòçüôåüá¶üá™"

She says: ""May not be much to some, but I am so much more happier in my skin now. I have come along way, and I just needed a push...Now I work out 3-4 times a week, can run a mile without killing myself, ENJOY any type of food.""‚Å£

I LOVE this photo of my Yiayia and Arna!! (My dads mum) üòç @tobi_pearce and Arna have now officially landed back in Adelaide and I already miss them SO much. It's only a few days but it will actually be the longest I've been away from Arna since she was born. It's hard to be away from her but I know she is in the BEST hands. I can tell you now my family are 100% looking forward to getting their cuddle quota in before I come back and steal her away hahaha (yes I'm looking at you @leahitsines). üòÇ

Personal footage behind the scene. Depicting the situation of Labuan Bajo. The other side of it.
"Art has the power to communicate; influence feeling and change perception. Art has the ability to interact with and educate the viewers about the earth issue, spreading awareness about such topics. We feel an instinctual need to take care of the things we feel connected to. Art can help renew, or sparks anew, our connection with nature.

A documentary project that I did with @_dozzy for @artotelgroup in collaboration with @wwf_id newest platform for environmental issue and sustainable movement.

In effort to raise awareness and donation for plastic pollution in Labuan bajo, @windisalomo as the art director invited @mulyakarya_yk, a collective of artist from Yogyakarta for a residency trip to create an artwork that reflect these issues.

I understand that we are facing a lot of environmental issues. But it comes along with an equal variety of solution for it. This is just a very tiny part of the effort.

Tomorrow I will share the full documentary, also @jessicajeli thinking process on developing the ArtotelEarth visual identity. Hope you guys enjoy it."
"It‚Äôs not always about the big idea, the tech solution and the grand plan. Sometimes all we need to make a better city is some humanity.

"Building bridges with @OutwardBoundOman ‚Äì The Duke of Cambridge joined young Omanis taking part in a training exercise at the Wadi al Arbaeen.

Outward Bound, which launched in Wales in 1941 to equip young people with important life skills through learning and adventures in the wild, was established in Oman in 2009.

At the wadi, The Duke joined young people, instructors and members of the community as they took part in activities designed to develop skills including leadership, resilience, and teamwork.

"Today, The Duchess of Cambridge became Royal Patron of @Family_Action.

Her Majesty The Queen @TheRoyalFamily has passed the patronage to The Duchess having held the role for over 65 years.

The Duchess joined children and families supported by Family Action at a Christmas tree farm and helped them to make Christmas decorations, eco-friendly reindeer food, and post their letters to Father Christmas!

Her Royal Highness also helped the children find Christmas trees for Family Action pre-schools, before heading back inside for some hot chocolate.

Family Action was founded in 1869 to help families in difficulty by giving them practical help and support. The charity works directly with vulnerable or disadvantaged children and families, and provides services including perinatal mental health services, counselling and therapeutic support, and the mentoring of children, young people and adults.

The new patronage aligns with The Duchess‚Äôs longstanding work on the early years, and the importance of supporting children and families during this seminal period of their lives."
"Near the Wadi al Arbaeen, The Duke of Cambridge visited the mountain village of Suwaih, where he received a spectacular musical welcome from the locals.

After meeting some of the locals, The Duke joined the village elders at an outdoor majlis seating area to learn more about life and challenges in the village today.

"Last night, The Duchess of Cambridge joined The Queen, The Prince of Wales and other Members of the Royal Family at a reception for @NATO leaders at Buckingham Palace, to mark 70 years of the Alliance.

The North Atlantic Treaty - or Washington Treaty - forms the basis of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation). It was signed on the 4th April 1949 by 12 founding members.

The NATO Alliance is now formed of 29 countries. It exists to protect the people and territory of its members, and is founded on the principle of collective defence.

The Duchess, along with other Members of the Royal Family, welcomed NATO leaders, members of their delegations and NATO staff in the Picture Gallery."
"Joining local fishermen üé£ on the traditional fishing skiffs on the beach in Oman, The Duke of Cambridge heard about how they fish, the challenges to sustainability, and actions being taken to conserve Oman‚Äôs marine environment.

At the Marine Science Centre The Duke also met Omani scientists collaborating with @cefasgovuk, to learn more about how the UK is supporting Oman aquaculture and fisheries to become more sustainable, particularly in the face of climate change.

"The Duke of Cambridge has spent time in Kuwait üá∞üáº and Oman üá¥üá≤ understanding the important security history of the region, and the UK‚Äôs üá¨üáß current links with both countries from a defence perspective.

In Kuwait, The Duke joined Kuwaiti and UK troops at Exercise Desert Warrior for the bi-annual training exercise.

The Duke then travelled to Musandam in Oman to learn more about the Royal Navy of Oman‚Äôs responsibilities monitoring maritime traffic passing through the Strait of Hormuz.

Oman and Kuwait are key partners for the UK ‚Äì The Duke met military personnel in both countries who are sharing expertise to improve security üì∑ Kensington Palace / PA

"Shooting hoops üèÄ at the Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Centre (@ascckw), where The Duke of Cambridge saw how the museum is educating and engaging young Kuwaitis in innovative ways across a range of areas, from space exploration and robotics to natural history and human biology.

The Duke joined children from local primary schools as they explored a number of the museum‚Äôs interactive zones, and heard more about how the cultural centre is enhancing UK-Kuwait üá¨üáßüá∞üáº relations, particularly in education and culture.

As part of his visit, The Duke also highlighted the role played by the British Council (@kwbritish) in empowering the next generation, particularly through the programme ‚ÄòTaqaddam‚Äô, (Arabic for ‚ÄòMoving forward‚Äô) which encourages innovative thinking among Kuwaiti school children to build up their life skills.

#RoyalVisitKuwait #Kuwait"
"On the first day of his official visit to Kuwait, at the Jahra Nature Reserve The Duke of Cambridge learned more about Kuwait‚Äôs ambitious plans to protect its natural environment from human and environmental challenges.

Scientists from Kuwait‚Äôs Environmental Public Authority (@epa_kw) üá∞üáº and the UK‚Äôs Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (@cefasgovuk) üá¨üáß are working in partnership to promote Kuwait‚Äôs biodiversity and inform its approach to marine environment conservation.

The Duke joined them on the reserve‚Äôs salt marshes, reed beds and sandy sabkha flats for several activities studying the wetlands‚Äô wildlife üî≠  including identifying some of the 300 species of birds seen at the reserve.

Kuwait is working to tackle the global issue of plastic pollution through a combination of raising public awareness, recycling, education and organising beach cleans - The Duke also joined a beach clean at the reserve.

"NEW‚ùóÔ∏èadidas x Dan Freebairn
If you‚Äôve been following my Instagram Story the last few weeks (see my highlights if you haven‚Äôt), you will have seen that I‚Äôve been working on a poster for next years adidas Superstar Anniversary. The print is now finished and I spent this afternoon hand signing and numbering 100 of them. Info on how you can get your hands on one will be announced soon. ‚úåüèª
‚Äî
Like all my projects with @adidasoriginals, I was really excited to be working with them again. But this one felt extra special... if you‚Äôve followed me a while, you‚Äôll know my favourite shoe is the Superstar. So when adidas asked me to be the one to tell this story and use my illustrations to highlight key moments in the shoe‚Äôs 50 year history, I was truly honoured. (Thanks to the team, you know who you are) I already knew a lot about the shoe, but I dived deeper to learn more and really immerse myself in the project. Then came the challenge of narrowing down 50 years of collaborations, anniversary colorways, introduction of new technologies, hyped releases and of course general releases. This I couldn‚Äôt do on my own. So I brought in two experts, @dave.lurky and @superstar_luke, both highly respected guys within the UK scene especially when it comes to shell toes, and both have unbelievable Superstar knowledge and collections. (I can‚Äôt thank you both enough for your input). I wanted the final list of shoes to touch on the Superstar‚Äôs early development, changes in design, shape, manufacturing and materials. As well as highlight key collaborations, pairs only true Superstar collectors will appreciate and iconic releases known by us all. I think we got the balance just right and I‚Äôm really happy with the final outcome. I can truthfully say I‚Äôve never put this much effort, detail and thought into a single poster before. I hope you like it, there‚Äôs more photos of the signing session in my story (shots to @morelifemyg for the shots), and as I said previously, stay tuned for info on how you can get one. A little teaser, these will be available for FREE. Put your money away üòâ‚úåüèª

‚Äî
For me, it‚Äôs cool to see. Using super premium materials on sneakers we know and love is amazing. But with the use of those materials come high retail prices, which means most of us can‚Äôt afford them. Then maybe these are just the first pieces to make statements with more affordable stuff on the way? Who knows... either way let me know what you think!? Comment below! üí¨üëáüèª

"Which is your favourite @OverkillShop x @adidasoriginals Collab? üí¨üëáüèª
‚Äî
#overkillsweetsixteen - I couldn‚Äôt choose just one adidas moment or release in Overkill‚Äôs 16 year history, so I picked 16 of them üòÇ There are a few that stand out to me though... Firstly the Mi ZX Flux, technically not a collab but still influential, I was one of many who made very similar pairs using the Black and Mint Green colour options. üëåüèª Then there‚Äôs the NMD R1 PK Firestarter, again not an Overkill collab but widely mistaken as one when @overkill_marc shared the first pictures of them. üî• Moving through the years we then got the EQT 93/17 and EQT ADV, both really clean colorways which pay homage to Kreuzberg‚Äôs traditional coat of arms. ‚öîÔ∏è And last but most certainly not least, there‚Äôs this years releases... both the ‚ÄòI Can If I Want‚Äô and ‚ÄòNo Walls Needed‚Äô packs are up their with the best adidas collabs in the last 5+ years in my opinion. Both brilliant looking, but also designed really well from the packaging to the aglets. üòç Next year is 2020, the 50th Anniversary of the Superstar and I really hope Overkill get to bring us a Superstar Collab. Fingers crossed. ü§ûüèª

It was 2 days before the Golden Trail Series final in the Annapurna‚Äôs region in Nepal, probably the most intelligent thing was to taper and do something short, but it is just hard to stay quiet on those surroundings. @davidemagnini had enough of sitting in a car so did I, so we jump down and started running, then that afternoon we went for a ‚Äúchill‚Äù run up to 4000m and on the way down we hit this sunset. I like racing but when we‚Äôre in places like that the energy that is given by the environment is just to strong. That day we ran 3,5h 25km with 2900 elevation meters. At the end it wasn‚Äôt that bad decision since I won the race and Davide was the runner up.
I think this image summarizes on a good way what sport means to me. A mean of transport, a (long) path to try a difficult goal, the mental processes of imagining how to do it, the connection between us and the mountains, that smallness feeling, the solitude, the acceptance of probable failure, the will of embracing compromise.

"In 2012 my feet measured 25cm long. Same as now, same as the previous years. But somehow I thought it would be a good idea to try a smaller ski boot (to win 4 or 5 grams, to be more fitted, or just to try...) so I asked @pierregignouxcarbonskiboots for a 24 size. In the first trainings it wasn‚Äôt that painful, and I thought that with the time the boot (or my feet) would adapt. But apparently the carbon doesn‚Äôt mold as I thought. The only problem was (1) when it was very cold and (2) when it was very long. In the first case, after a long cold day in Migot at Chardonnet (previous post) my big toe was a bit cold (for a few years). In the second, my feet were bleeding a bit after every world cup race. So after 3 month I went back to my size 25 boots...

"7 years ago @vivianbruchez introduced me to steep skiing. That day we meet at the bergschrund of Chardonnet, we climbed to its summit and skied the north face via the Migot spur line. Before that Stephane Brosse had introduced me to the more classical steep skiing limes in Cham and the Aravis, and show me a bit of the wonders of this way to climb and downclimb summits. That day in Chardonnet was the first time I skied with Vivian (and with ‚Äòlarge‚Äô skis) and afterwards I have been learning a lot from him in all our journeys. Since that day steep skiing has been one of my main activities.

"Headstand is the foundation of all other inversions. Put in the work to build good technique when you‚Äôre learning to balance in Sirsasana and you‚Äôll have a stable base to progress from. But that also works the other way. Whatever bad technique you learn gets multiplied as the poses get harder. So what may have been ok for headstand can sometimes create serious structural issues in forearm balance or handstand. If you have a slight banana shape in headstand, you‚Äôll have an ever more pronounced banana shape as the inversions get more demanding. Good technique is not about right and wrong. It‚Äôs about physical efficiency, energy optimization and long term health of the body. 
_
Tips‚Äî
1. Foundation‚Äîwork your shoulders and keep the elbows rooted. If you feel your foundation shifting, don‚Äôt try and lift up.
2. Core‚Äîkeep a slight engagement of the front body while in headstand and draw the lower ribs in.
3. Center line‚Äîpractice orienting towards the center line of the body by using all the muscles to draw in and up.
4. Patience‚Äîbe willing to put in the work even if it means you won‚Äôt do the pose for awhile, be willing to fail properly rather than fake succeed. 
5. Feeling‚Äîconsciously feel the body and work from a place of embodiment and understanding rather than from force.
6. Practice‚Äîkeep practicing, keep the faith.

"We have been told there is someone perfect out there for us who will complete us, a knight in shining armor, a fairytale princess, the mythic ‚Äúone‚Äù we have been waiting for. But we must each fall madly in love with ourselves to be whole. No other person carries the key to unlock your hidden potential. It‚Äôs you who has to make your own magic.
_
We have been trained to want a linear, straight path forward and up. More, bigger better, stronger, deeper. The endless cycle of desire devouring everything in its wake, thinking that just one more thing will finally be enough, but it never is. Real life is full of peaks and valleys. Joy and happiness are part of very foundation of the journey, not the prize you get for running up the mountain all fast and furious. 
_
We sleep walk through life, like zombies, following subconscious orders that lead to our own demise without ever realizing. We are conditioned to be cogs in a machine whose sole end is to devour everything. That is, until we wake up from the dream and jailbreak our minds. Then, it all changes. You no longer wait to live a good life, you allow life live out its goodness through you.
_
Awakening is returning.
The spiritual path is nothing more than a homecoming. 
You are who you have always been.
But you are not who you think you are.

"What is Yoga?
_
Hint: Yoga is much more than just bending, twisting and lifting the body.
_
Yoga as it is understood and practiced in the contemporary Western world usually begins with the body. Many students come to the practice in search of physical healing or physical benefits, such as increased flexibility or strength. Others come to the practice thinking it will be a good workout. The body and the yoga poses, known as asanas, are not ends in and of themselves. Instead these are tools used for the cultivation of a more subtle state of mind. 
_
Truly understanding what yoga is can be difficult. And perhaps yoga is many different things to many different people. As a beginner, you may think of yoga as stretching, twisting or bending the body. Some may think of yoga as another fitness trend that promises health. If you skim through media images, you might think yoga is all young, fit, flexible, able-bodied people doing handstands at beautiful destinations around the world. For some aspiring yogis, yoga represents a career path. For the ancient yogis of India, yoga was something much deeper...

"Where you are going is not always where you have been. Good times may pass you by in fits of obliviousness and naive disregard. Happiness always appears like it will last forever. Bliss feels eternal. But, everything changes. The highs and lows twist and turn, leaving waves of growth and change in their wake. You might only realize where you‚Äôve been once everything has shifted. It‚Äôs often in retrospect that you see that the very moment you took for granted was indeed special, filled with its own blessings. It‚Äôs easy to miss the magic whileworrying or stressing about some uncontrollable outcome. It requires great maturity and awareness to recognize happiness as happiness, joy as joy, sadness as sadness, anger as anger, and all as impermanent.

I have changed so much since this photo was taken that it feels like I live in a whole new galaxy. Sometimes I am embarrassed about the bad decisions I made, how I was swept away by materialism, ego, fame, and other worldly goals. But then I remember not to beat myself up about the person I was. Everything I‚Äôve been through has lead me here, to a place of peace filled with a joyful kindness I never imagined possible. Where I‚Äôve been does not define where I am, where I am is not where I‚Äôm going. And yet, I am here, whole, complete, going nowhere and everywhere, same, same, but oh so different.

"Magic is everywhere, if only you have the eyes to see. Don‚Äôt let the burdens of life dim your glimmer. If things seem complicated and difficult, don‚Äôt give up hope. Nothing is permanent, neither pleasure nor pain. Sooner or later, the tide will turn and what was old will be new again, what was fresh will be forgotten. Your job is not to try and control the fantasy, but instead to experience the mystery of it all as one big joy-filled ride.

"Asteya. Non-stealing. What does this mean to you and how do you apply this core yogic concept to your practice and your life?
_
If you run a business it could mean to refrain from engaging in unethical business practices, such as stealing, bribery, intimidation, bullying, deceit, cheating, copying, misrepresenting, misappropriation, and other similar morally questionable and harmful actions. 
_
In your practice, it could mean not doing poses or practices that your body isn‚Äôt ready for even if your mind desires then. It could also mean not claiming the knowledge or teaching of another person or culture as your own. For Western yogis, it could mean consciously refraining from acts of cultural appropriation.
_
I‚Äôm not here to provide the definitive answer, but I am here the spark the processing of questioning. How else do you see Asteya and how else would you apply it to practice and life?

"I heard a rumor that there‚Äôs only a day or two left before the @secondhome_la Pavilion closes at La Brea Tar Pits here in Los Angeles. So if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôve seen or heard about and you were waiting to go to, don‚Äôt wait anymore. I recently had the chance to see it when my dear friends @mumhad1ofthose & @descurran were visiting from London, and I was relieved to find it is free to enter. I‚Äôm always a fan of art that‚Äôs free for all to experience because it‚Äôs one of the most beautiful things in life. And while I understand it can‚Äôt always be free, when it is, it removes that barrier to entry and gives everyone the chance to be inspired in the way art can be inspiring and entertaining.
.
Anyway, the #secondhomela pop up ‚Äútent-like‚Äù structure designed by SelgasCano known as an art sculpture is part of Second Home which is a socially responsible British business with a belief that diversity makes creativity stronger. They create spaces that bring diverse groups of people together and that‚Äôs something I admire. While it has been here in LA, it has hosted live music, performance art, talks, dances and screenings. Their hashtag is #lovelettertoLA but they might as well say it‚Äôs a love letter to humanity and what can happen when we come together in a safe space where differences are celebrated and community is valued.
.
That being said, the co-working and private offices spaces that Second Home offers which are permanent are not exactly affordable. But this is a feed about travel and that‚Äôs another conversation for another day. If you‚Äôre traveling around Los Angeles this weekend, stop by the Pavilion before it closes and let me know what you think of it.... üòâüíõ

"Didn‚Äôt sleep well last night after seeing my dear friend @neumarc‚Äôs Stories from a Venezia where there is a flooding event occurring, bringing high tides just shy of the devastating record-high ‚Äúaqua alta‚Äù of 1966. St Mark‚Äôs Basilica is flooded. Which, before 2018, had happened only 4 times in more than 900 years. Or only 6 times total in 1,200 years depending on what and where you read online. üôÄ Because Marco is my friend, I worried for his safety and I still worry as the danger is not passed.
.
It‚Äôs stamped a much more personal note on a crisis that I‚Äôve already been aware of and have been trying to do my part to combat. We can try to ignore it, we can choose to believe it‚Äôs not as bad as some say or even that we can‚Äôt do much to change things. But we can. And we must.
.
We all have hundreds of choices a day that, made the right way - can help make a difference. We can try to eliminate all single use plastic from our lives. We can fly less and take cleaner transportation when we do travel. ‚úàÔ∏è We can donate to organizations that plant trees which absorb co2 or even more importantly, give to organizations that protect old trees from being cut down since older trees absorb co2 more rapidly than younger trees. üå≥ We can vote in representatives and leaders that believe there is a climate crisis and that will fight to make laws and processes that will combat the problems. You can request that your energy supplier only use clean energy - something Dant√© & I have done here in California. üí° We can unplug or power off our tech when we‚Äôre not using it. üîå We can choose not to waste food, grow our own food, eat less meat and buy local whenever possible. ü•¨ü•ï We can choose to walk, ride bikes or take public transportation instead of an Uber or Lyft. üö≤ We can choose to buy less and consume less. And so. much. more.
.
I know it‚Äôs not always easy to see how these actions might directly have a positive effect on lessening the occurrence of floods or wildfires. But they do. Research has proven that. We just have to choose to listen. And act. If not for ourselves, then for those we care about. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Like I said yesterday, I partnered with @Ford and @LonelyPlanet to discover greater Los Angeles. #ad A map, that was painted on a wall just off Melrose, acted as the springboard for my adventures into the history and culture of Los Angeles. üå¥ My first stop was the mural which then led to Olvera Street, created in 1930 ‚Äúto preserve and present the customs and trades of early California." Today the area boasts many vendors who are second or third generation sellers as well as museums dedicated to Chinese, Italian & Mexican heritage. üá≤üáΩ Next I visited downtown‚Äôs Central Library, home of LA‚Äôs written history, beautiful rotundas and (when I was there) an exhibition of Ansel Adams photographs. üìö Then Highland Park Bowl, home of LA‚Äôs oldest bowling lanes and a dynamic spot to just hang out. It has a bar area with a steampunk-meets-vintage-sports vibe. The restored lanes are backed by a stunning mural that looks like it depicts California‚Äôs iconic Redwood and Sequoia trees. üé≥ I was happy to see the Original Farmer‚Äôs Market was part of this map-based exploration since it is one of my favorite places to go where the French store Monsieur Marcel is usually my first stop if I am planning a picnic or want a bottle of wine for a special occasion. It‚Äôs also a great choice if you‚Äôre craving multiple cuisines and want to share lots of small plates with friends. There are grocery vendors, a toy shop, a stall with the largest selection of hot sauces that I have ever seen and more. üá´üá∑ Ending closest to our home at El Capitan theatre, I watched a movie from a balcony seat which took me back to the days of going to plays and musicals with my mom when I was a kid. üé≠ After perusing all the classic black and white Hollywood photos in the hallways, I was pretty much the last one to leave before seating for the next showing started and what was happening outside? Of course, setup for a movie premiere! üìΩ Check out my Stories for video from all these stops üöô #everydayexplorations

"Living in California has given me a new perspective on nature. Both its majesty and inherent wonder but also its capacity for destruction as I‚Äôve watched communities and lives all around our own home, affected by fire. When I took this photo many people assumed that‚Äôs what this was. In fact, it‚Äôs the effect of a 20 second exposure that captured the lights of cars as they drove through marine layer fog in Malibu Canyon.
.
Yet just after I posted this, the same hills were engulfed in flames and a year later, it‚Äôs happening again not far from where I stood to take this and in many other places around California.
.
I‚Äôve watched my friends displaced from their homes and can‚Äôt help but feel grateful to our public servants like firefighters and first responders who walk right into danger to ensure the rest of us go to sleep safely at night and wake up safe the next morning. I know that by choosing to live here it‚Äôs probably not a matter of if but just when, I will have need of the same protection. And that‚Äôs ok. Living here has taught me the value of gratefulness and the importance of cherishing each and every day when it‚Äôs happening.
.
If you‚Äôre a firefighter or first responder or anyone who helps keep others safe, thank you. If you know one, be extra kind to them, don‚Äôt take them for granted. And thank you too for supporting them because being their support isn‚Äôt always easy either. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Happy Halloween! üéÉüîÆ My treat, not trick, for the holiday is this last photo from picturesque Franconia in Germany. As delectable as the wines were, the half timbered-homes, towns and villages were almost enough to steal the show during my press trip with @germanytourism.
.
From B√ºrgstadt to Miltenberg to Volkach to Iphofen and K√∂nigsberg, there was no shortage of picturesque vistas and charming facades to capture so even if [gasp! üôÄ] wine isn‚Äôt your thing, Franconia still has much to inspire and thrill with its towns, food, people and history. I‚Äôll be publishing a full photo essay on my site before the weekend showing more. But for now, Stories will continue to go live and there‚Äôs already an article on every winery we visited live on kirstenalanaphotography dot com. Link in profile of course! #visitfranconia

Unless memory fails me, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äòve been in a wine region during harvest. What a special time it was to be in Franconia! The region is large enough, the soil diverse enough and the physical landscape changes in such a way that harvest was just completed in some of the towns we visited with @germanytourism while in other locales it was still occurring. I noticed that harvesting by hand was more common than I‚Äôve heard of in the industry at a larger scale, as were more traditional ways of processing grapes such as stomping them physically instead of using machines. The first image was taken in @hassbergetourismus where we went for a long walk in the rolling hills covered with vineyards, overlooking a valley punctuated by picturesque villages, and were able to see harvest taking place by hand before sitting down for a picnic lunch amongst the vines. What a magical experience, which I truly hope anyone who loves wine can have at minimum once in their life. To see the vines that grew the grapes that were in the wine we were drinking while talking with the people who harvested and made the wine, had an effect on the taste [for me] that is challenging to quantify. Though I‚Äôm realizing that as a photographer and storyteller, I value the connection to local people most of all while traveling. Now wine harvest is something I want to experience elsewhere to see how it might differ from place to place. After all, the same grapes can be used to make wines with such variety, the landscapes of wine areas can differ so much and yet the culture of the people who make wine can also have so many similarities.  I think it‚Äôs like humanity as a whole, in that we have more in common than we like to think and I wish we concentrated more often on what unites us rather than what divides us. Speaking of that, the group I did this press trip with was made up of people from Sweden, the Netherlands, China, Slovakia and the USA. Many have already begun to publish their articles and I wonder, would you like me to link to some of them in Stories so that you can read them in your native language if you‚Äôre from any of those countries? I‚Äôm happy to do so! ‚ù§Ô∏èüçáüç∑ #visitfranconia
"Do you like traveling to wine regions? Tasting wine when you travel, at wineries and in vineyards? I certainly do and yet, as I said before, I was surprised when I was invited by @germanytourism to #visitfranconia that not only did I not even know about this wine region but also that it's not exactly ""new."" Instead, just like in other wine areas around the world, there is a tradition of wine making in Franconia that goes back to at least the 1800s (even though some newer wineries were only formed in the 1970s, there's variety for sure, still it) means there are beautiful cellars and dramatic underground spaces all around the region. I showed a few, like the one pictured here at Zur Schwane in Volkach, in Stories already and those are saved as a permanent highlight in my profile. Another thing I was happy to learn while on this press trip is that Franconia has its own wine bottle in a shape that's quite unexpected. See the second photo to understand what I mean. There are many stories from many different residents that might explain its history but I think the most likely is that it's meant to symbolize the shape that was created when parts of animals were once used as the vessels to carry around liquid. When hung from a belt or trousers, the vessel bulged at the bottom and had a longer neck. It makes sense! Though doesn't exactly make me thirsty. Still, it's another fun piece of history and trivia for a region that has much to surprise and delight already. And I always love a good story.

Both images were taken with my #Pixel3 which has been impressing me with it's low light capability. I've always loved experimenting with smartphones of all kinds for photography and now that I have the 3, I can understand why so many of my photo colleagues are firmly #TeamPixel"
"Franconia Wine Region in Germany is a bit of an underdog in the landscape of European wines [in my experience]. Even working in travel now where wine is a significant part of so many stories, having grown up in a family where wine was always important in celebration, and having worked in a wine store in Brooklyn with my dear friend @joeybear85 where we often sold German white wines‚Ä¶ I departed for this trip thinking, ‚ÄúFranconia? Have I even had any wine from Franconia?‚Äù
üç∑
Did you know there was a German wine region called Franconia? Or Franken?
üç∑
Obviously, there is - I‚Äôve been there now and wow is it ever a great example of how we should never bet against the underdog. Like other regions in the country, Franconia boasts some incredible white wines with the Silvaner heavily featuring in many winery lineups. It was sometimes referred to, during my visit, as THE grape of Franconia. But the region also boasts other award-winning White wines and a slew of notable Red wines. The changing climate has enabled the region to diversify production which has also been helped by the generational shifts that naturally occur in so many industries where children take over from parents. Some Franconia wineries are only on their 2nd generation of ownership but are already producing wines that should get far more recognition worldwide than they do. Some families, like F√ºrst [VDP] who own the land pictured in this image, have been making wine since the 1600s.. But more recent generations have been the ones to truly innovate & facilitate change. For instance, it was Paul F√ºrst & his son who actually undid some of the modernization that had occurred in the family‚Äôs system of making wine and returned many processes back to an older way of doing things. When we visited, grapes were being stomped by foot ala ‚ÄòI Love Lucy.‚Äô And a photo from that moment is one of my favorites that I took during the trip. As were, the F√ºrst wines. I brought a bottle home with me that will age well, which I will save to share with loved ones during some special moment in the future. I hope to inspire you to take a similar journey with the posts I will share about this press trip. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Just home from drinking all the wine and wandering all the most absurdly picturesque streets I‚Äôve ever wandered in @germanytourism and now that I‚Äôve finally gone through the thousands of photos I took during my press trip, I‚Äôm looking forward to sharing the stories of the adventure, starting tomorrow.

"A year ago, I was strolling the streets of Tallinn and enjoying autumn in Europe with my dear friends @mumhad1ofthose, @neumarc & @monicasuma.
.
We‚Äôd opted to skip the included shore excursion on our @vikingcruises itinerary in favor of simply walking around, taking photos and getting to know one another better. It was a wonderful day of fellowship and creativity. Though we each have different styles when it comes to the pictures we take and the things we notice, we all found things to love about Tallinn. With a darling historic centre as well as modern areas home to shipping container restaurants and futuristic architecture, there‚Äôs something for almost every type of traveler. Monica‚Äôs suggestion of lunch at Rataskaevu 16 followed by drinks at @botaanikbar, added the cherry on top. If you visit Tallinn, please make sure you don‚Äôt skip either business.
.
And if Europe at this time of year is your thing, today on Twitter at 9 AM PST you can get even more ideas on where to go in Sep/Oct/Nov because the theme of today‚Äôs #TravelSkills chat is Fall/Autumn in Europe. There are always so many great ideas shared in this chat, that I struggle with how not to just buy a new plane ticket every week üòù But Europe is the part of the globe I love most and where I never need any extra convincing to travel to. Are you like that as well?

Iran, a beautiful country with beautiful people. But at the moment people are dying there in silence. The regime has shut down the internet since saturday to prevent Iranians from sharing their stories. Protesters are being killed. Thousands arrested. It‚Äôs hard to get any news out into the world since they are being totally cut off. My thoughts are with the iranians. Stay strong! #iranprotests

I‚Äôve been so lucky to visit my family in Nassau since childhood, and in those times I‚Äôve seen countless Americans use the Bahamian islands as their playground for letting loose and vacationing. And now we turn our back on the people who welcomed us with open arms, when they‚Äôve lost everything !? There‚Äôs no excuse for this... and if you have one your a real piece of üí© 
Bahamians will persevere, but help along the way is greatly appreciated. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è üáßüá∏"

"a few days ago i already showed you the entrance hall of the #goetheanum complex, that‚Äôs located near basel / switzerland (have a look at my recent posts if you missed it).
here are some final #outofthephone snaps from that quirky place that left me like something between brutalism and hobbiton. what do you think?
it‚Äôs definitely a place to visit for all #archilovers plus people who like batik-looking stairwells!
enjoy your friday everyone!
#dornach #rudolfsteiner #goetheanumstyle"
"captured some #residensity on my very short stop in #mannheim last friday.
these #brutiful towers are actually some of the tallest in the region (100m tall) and if you swipe left you can also see a view from above + some perfectly aligned birds at the nearby river #neckar.
after christmas i‚Äôll be in mannheim again, trying to make more time to take shoot the city.
took all pictures straight #outofthephone using my @huaweimobilede #HuaweiP30Pro in 5x zoom (135mm focal lenght) - i can only repeat it became my favourite lense on this device.
#hfk #huaweifotokonsortium | ad/anzeige"
"another snapshot from last week‚Äôs short stop in rainy #basel when @vomstreunern stuck inside ‚Äòintersections‚Äô by #richardserra - a monumental outdoor sculpture that you can find right in front of the basel theatre.
#bepartofart #puddlegram #outofthephone"
"this week i had the chance to visit the #goetheanum building in #dornach (switzerland), maybe you‚Äôve seen some of the footage in my stories earlier.
the location is known as the world center of the anthroposophical movement, founded and designed by #rudolfsteiner in the 1920‚Äòs. as you can see in this picture he turned away from the concept of using right angles as a basis for the building plan, which leads to many odd shapes and architectural details and means you won‚Äôt find any real symmetric structure throughout the whole complex. all of these organic looking walls, columns and ceilings have been set up with visible concrete, which wasn‚Äôt very common at this time either - a vanguard of brutalist architecture so to say.
as i went to a rudolf steiner / waldorf school when i was a kid and teenager, it was kinda like a school time flashback for me to visit that place too.
#concretewonderland #tinypeopleinbigplaces #outofthephone"
"who else had a typical melancholic november sunday? i went for some hours by train through silent and gloomy germany today and had lots of time to think and contemplate but also to review this picture that i took only 3 days ago in #berlin. yes, it‚Äôs yet another classic sunset view but totally fits my mood today...
just like many other pictures on my account i took this picture handheld straight #outofthephone with my @huaweimobilede #HuaweiP30Pro - i guess the 5x zoom became easily my favourite weapon of choice when i take photos, even in lower light situations. always surprised by the outcome!

"mixed memories of my latest trip to #eindhoven and #helmond - two dutch cities in the region of #brabant, only 15 minutes away from each other and both with a lot of interesting urban projects as you could hopefully see.
thanks to @visitbrabant for including me in this years #brabantisopen campaign, i‚Äôve learnt a lot about the region during my two trips in september and november and felt some great hospitality too.

"one more interesting project i‚Äôve visited in #eindhoven 
it‚Äôs actually a former philips radio factory complex from the 1920‚Äòs. just a few years ago it got transformed by @diederendirrix architects into a modern residential housing project. the industrial building is heritage listed, so the architects retained many traces of the past, that would still fit the overall look and feel. you can see the original concrete beams in the pictures above for example.
nowadays the building is used for social housing with quite affordable rents, which i find quite amazing.
special thanks to @nappyc taking time and showing us around that hidden gem.
#thisiseindhoven #strijps #antonbuilding #brabantisopen"
"ad/anzeige | only 15 minutes by train from eindhoven you‚Äôll reach the pitoresque city of #helmond with more cool places to discover.
i went there for about 24hours and was especially curious to see some of the first cube houses, designed by dutch architect #pietblom from 1977 - even earlier than the famous golden #kubuswoningen in rotterdam.
for helmond he made 3 prototypes first and 15 more later, that are nowadays still inhabited by normal residents. his plan was to tilt the cube of a conventional building exactly 45 degrees to optimise the use of space and light within the houses.
although the should look like a group of trees standing next to each other, i had the impression the look like mushrooms growing out of the pavement.
anyway, it‚Äòs been great to try to capture these truly unique buildings in different light situations.
since tiny houses are becoming en vogue again, they might helpful to overcome the split between increasing urban density and personal individuality on the other hand.
i am really curious what you guys think about this kind of buildings. would you even like to live in some of these or does it seem to impractical for you? let me know in the comments!

~ So it‚Äôs probably already clear that my favorite animals to photograph are foxes. I was going trough my archives for my up coming book when I realized that I have photographed foxes at least in six different countries! That‚Äôs pretty cool! So here‚Äôs a fox portrait collection from my past five years of intense fox photographing all around the world. ( Countries: Netherlands, Greenland, Chile, Finland, Iceland & Svalbard) Which fox is your favorite? ü¶ä
~ 6 am in the streets of Nuorgam the northern most town in Finland. I‚Äôm on my way to the airport, tired after week of shooting on a project in the Arctic region. I‚Äôm rushing towards the airport when I suddenly see a familiar looking movement on the side of the road. It‚Äôs -28 Celsius that morning so the fox is on a full winter fluffy coat. I jump out of the car and observe the movements of the fox for a few minutes before it‚Äôs gone to do its daily routines. A brief moment of joy and sense of no time. I jump back to the car and I am back to do my own daily routines. It‚Äôs these little moments and encounters that I live for.

For those of you that are inspired by me, remember this, always help the people around you. Don‚Äôt always make it about you. Don‚Äôt be selfish. Don‚Äôt just have yes men around you, have people that will tell you how it is and be real with you 100% of the time. 
Lastly, shoutout to my real friends, my family and the supporters that had my back since day. I read a lot of messages during my time training and the support I had was unreal so thank you üôåüèø Shout out @newtrition4life too for being the best chef ever üôåüèøüôåüèøüôåüèø

The Best Ever @floydmayweather
Fight camp done. This has hands down been the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life. Training twice a day (3 times on Tuesdays) and mountain runs on the Saturdays with Sundays to rest. My body has been pushed to a point I never knew I had. I came to Vegas to be trained by the best with no distractions and I have come out an absolute beast. Throughout this period I have missed my family, my friends and my beautiful girlfriend, but they all understood that me training in Vegas was necessary. I‚Äôm not lying when I say this, Logan Paul will not be able to handle me. I‚Äôm gonna drag him into deep waters. Shannon Briggs and all his other yes men can motivate Logan all they want, but when November 9th comes and he‚Äôs staring into my eyes in that ring, he will know he‚Äôs already lost. I hit hard, you know that, so I hope you‚Äôre prepared to work Logan, because 6 rounds of hell is coming your way...That‚Äôs if you last that long...Thank you @cityathleticboxing for your hospitality.

Portrait of a prince / Kalahari @southafrica
Railroad tracks, illuminated as they cut through the twilight in #TolarGrande #Argentina. The sun had been down for nearly 45 minutes when I shot this but the landscape was still glowing, reflecting off the sky and exaggerated by the inordinate amount of dust kicked up by the wind. As we crossed the tracks I could faintly make out the scene, but through my camera and a long exposure it was a completely different sight. As a photographer you‚Äôre always chasing light and moments like this are always special and fleeting. I snapped off a handful of long exposures as the remaining light quickly faded out, leaving me with this picture to remember the evening.
One of the best parts of every shoot are the in between moments, the banter, the people you meet and the conditions you work in. This carousel of content here is a lot of behind the scenes from a recent shoot in Veracruz Mx on the Alsesca River I was DP on for @jaybirdsport and @camp4collective. It was a blast and an experience I‚Äôm sincerely grateful for, hope you enjoy this mini BTS look into the shoot!

In the flamingo world, vibrant pigment is a sign of health and nutrients. I photographed this stunning #flamingo here in South Africa, it‚Äôs beautiful pigment is directly correlated with a high keratin based diet, likely from shrimp.

I can‚Äôt get over the look on this #leopardSeal‚Äôs face. As cute and adorable as it appears, it‚Äôs actually sizing me up to see if I‚Äôm competition for food in anyway. This 10 foot long, curious seal had me swimming in circles to keep it from getting behind me and occasionally displayed its teeth to me and the 8 inch dome of my camera that was surely acting like a mirror of sorts. Once establishing that I was either too ambivalent or stupid to hunt, it playfully went on with its business. Shooting in the icy waters of Antarctica is no easy thing - your fingers and toes can only handle so much and your face swells up and feels like it‚Äôs full of Novacaine. A small price to pay for such an incredible experience like this. Photographed for @natgeo on an unforgettable assignment with @paulnicklen @mitty @andy_mann @sealegacy

In this episode of Lane giving off Dad vibes... we're gonna talk about small engine maintenance and how @stabilbrand makes products to keep your engines running smoothly through all seasons. Being in NC these last few years, I've learned you can't just store your tools and expect them to work after winter without a little help. @stabilbrand storage, fogging oil & rust stopper are perfect for the job. #stabilpartner #toolshed #americanbully #americanbulldog #nc
Welcome to my lair üî•Getting organized is one of my favorite things to do and remodeling a house gets really messy so I was thrilled when @gladiatorbrand sent me some of their storage solutions and workbenches to make the remodel less chaotic üôåüèº #gladiatorgarage #sponsored #toolshed #toolstorage

"Happy #WorldKindnessDay üí´

I‚Äôve had a couple of negative comments on here recently, one in particular yesterday left me feeling a bit heavy.

Sometimes your words to someone don‚Äôt have to be malicious, intimidating or aggressive, sometimes they can just be unkind and that‚Äôs enough to cause upset.

Today is the perfect reminder for all of us who have social media to use our words kindly and mindfully because they are powerful beyond measure.

@jeffbrownsoulshaping says it best - ‚ÄúWords. So powerful. They can crush a heart, or heal it. They can shame a soul, or liberate it. They can shatter dreams, or energise them. They can obstruct connection, or invite it. They can create defences, or melt them. We have to use words wisely.‚Äù Photography by @lana.prins üå∏"
"Ladies, sisters, friends. Big smiles here and beyond excited to tell you about two special somethings I‚Äòve been working on!

Introducing Elixir and Goddess üí´

Two separate, four week courses for you to choose from if you‚Äòre ready to begin a journey of empowerment, healing and growth.

These two babies are my commitment in navigating and supporting you through any emotional challenges you may currently be facing in your life.

We all carry an innate power inside of ourselves and I want to guide you towards uncovering and unleashing yours.

Come and feel empowered!

"UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.

What does it mean to you?

I think many of us believe we love unconditionally, because ‚Äúunconditional‚Äù feels like the right word to describe the intensity we feel when we deeply love and care for someone.

But unconditional love is one of the most challenging things we human beings can master.

This doesn‚Äôt just start and end with intimate relationships - it‚Äôs apparent in friendships and parenting too.

We allow ourselves to expect a lot from one person. And a lot of the time, if those expectations aren‚Äôt met then we feel disappointment, annoyance, anger or frustration towards them.

To love unconditionally means there are no conditions and there are no expectations.

It means you accept them for who they are, both their shadow and their light.

It means you honour and respect their boundaries and triggers and consciously avoid causing them any pain.

It means you forgive their mistakes instead of holding it against them.

It means you hold space for them when they need it, even if it feels uncomfortable for you.

It means you consciously communicate with them, rather than the ol‚Äô blame and shame.

And it means every single day, you commit to your own self development and growth so that you can be the highest, healthiest and happiest version of yourself to benefit not only them, but every other person you connect with in your lifetime too.

"Babes! A while ago I asked you what values you look for in a partner and almost all of you said trust.

So I went on a little explore of trust - what it means and how we can get our hands on some of it.

If you want to hear more, have a listen to my latest podcast Cultivating Trust on itunes and spotify (search Temple of Her) and insight timer (search my name)

Love love x"
"To create real connection with another person, we have to allow ourselves to be seen. And we can‚Äôt truly be seen without first becoming vulnerable.

Yet we have attached so many negative connotations to vulnerability. We see it as a weakness and something to be ashamed of.

I encourage you to speak openly about your worries, fears and doubts. Speak about them whilst they are there, instead of once they are all packaged up and dealt with.

True vulnerability is speaking your truth amidst your pain and suffering.

There is no shame in carrying pain. It is a part of the human experience and none of us will escape this life without it. So let‚Äôs break open, embrace our vulnerability with open arms and share our challenges with one another.

There is a different kind of life and love you will experience by living whole heartedly through your vulnerability.

And by remaining open and honest, we can watch those intimate connections we have always dreamt of ~ come to life.

Excited to share this weeks episode where I delve into ways in which you can discover the magic of your menstruation, with tools and practices in harnessing your cycle and learning to explore and understand it on a much deeper level.

"I‚Äôve been living with an outdated narrative.

Valuing past experiences as too expensive.

Allowing them to define who I am.

By holding on to them, I am validating an old part of myself that no longer serves me.

I am not my thoughts.

I am not what happened to me.

I have evolved, grown and lived because of them, but they do not define me.

I am grateful for all the experiences I have been through, they have all been a vital part of my journey.

And because of them, I have been guided into a place where I have learnt to trust myself even more.

Where I have learnt that I am safe.

I am loved.

And I am whole. üïä

This year has been one of the most transformative and difficult years of my life, if not THE most transformative and difficult. I have said no to all but a handful of travel jobs (despite this being my main source of income since I left my old career üë©üèº‚Äçüç≥.) I ran my first tours to Zimbabwe amongst a huge amount of self doubt and fear, and with a lot of unnecessary stress playing a part on the side (Long story, I‚Äôll tell it one day!) I went off the pill despite spending my previous years on earth swearing I didn‚Äôt want children, and now I‚Äôm pregnant ü§∞üèº. I spent all of my money, and I did it intentionally to break a rigid and negative money mindset. (It was all invested back into my business and into personal development and upskilling.) I also; massively leveled up the Travel Bootcamp with the girls, co-released a new program into the world (Summer Camp üòçüèÑüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è - it‚Äôs a Bootcamp thang), lost a best friend (her choice) , opened my heart to more people than I thought possible ‚ù§Ô∏è, had deeper conversations with people than I‚Äôve ever had in my life, released stored emotion that manifested as back pain from my body, mended the relationship with my cousin, severed the relationship with my brother, improved my relationship with my partner in a million ways and lost my dad to cancer. And through it all I‚Äôve somehow lost my fear of change and learned a lot of lessons along the way. Namely: 1) We actually have nothing to fear - lean into that feeling and get comfortable being uncomfortable. There‚Äôs so much joy on the other side. 2) The human heart has a limitless ability to love and forgive. Let others really see you. Vulnerability is strength. 3) Sometimes people are not meant to be in your life. Don‚Äôt hold onto relationships that don‚Äôt serve you, but don‚Äôt give up too easily either 4) If we don‚Äôt change, nothing changes. Spend the time to get to know yourself. Slow down, stop the negative self talk, journal, create, tell yourself that you‚Äôre beautiful and kind and enough. Do it daily.  5) This world is what we make of it. ‚ÄúWe do not see things as they are, we see them as we are.‚Äù - Ana√Øs Nin. Beliefs are only thoughts and they can change.
"The Victoria Falls are alive, well and FLOWING! I was surprised this week when I started receiving messages from friends asking if the Victoria Falls had dried up! üò± Luckily for me, I know a few people in the Vic Falls area and I‚Äôd happened to see them posting about the falls this week. Yes, Zimbabwe is currently experiencing drought but no, the falls are far from drying up! (They‚Äôre even still getting the rainbow in the spray üåàüåà.) Sensationalist news reporting can be hugely damaging to fragile tourism industries like Zimbabwe üáøüáºand visitor numbers have already tangibly dropped. üòí GO TO ZIMBABWE! Seriously. I am 100% running tours in Zim next year and the tourism product is still incredible. If anything they need you now more than ever. ‚ù§Ô∏è .

"I‚Äôve been dying to share this shot, because it was super random how it came about! I had seen a post on @jarradseng ‚Äòs feed üì±üì∏ of this street and thought it looked absolutely amazing! (If you don‚Äôt follow Jarrad already, you‚Äôre welcome! üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) However, the geotag just said ‚ÄúJapan‚Äù, so I had no idea where it was taken. üáØüáµü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Not a handful of days later I was in Kiso and thought to show the post to my guide Taka on the off chance it was in the same region ... and IT WAS! üò± This is the post town of Narai and it‚Äôs actually super easy to find. The street itself is 1km long and most visitors simply walk from one end to the other. üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíÉüèº Right now there are fall colours üçÅüçÇüçÅ galore and one of the stores even had a wood fire goingüî•. I sat at the end of the street enjoying a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è and waited for the action to unfold as locals watered their plants üå∏, took their rubbish out and greeted each other in the street. From all the moments I captured, this one was my fave. ‚ù§Ô∏è #VisitKiso #KisoMe

"During my time in Kiso my guide Taka got a pretty good handle on the sorts of things I like to photograph - particularly pretty things. üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüçÅüíô We had a morning planned to visit Otaki Village to see the shrine ‚õ©üí¶ and their popular waterfalls, however, we ended up spending a fair bit of time on the roads leading in and out of town. üöôüõ£‚õ∞ I don‚Äôt even know how to begin to describe how to find this place. It was literally a turn off on the road that led to an old tunnel and as soon as you popped out you for this view off the bridge. üò±üòç I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen water this blue in my life and I have seen some blue ass water! üíôüí¶ So, as much as I‚Äôm a fan of the classics, and generally do visit the tourist hot spots, I always advise to explore! I can honestly say that I‚Äôve never seen another instagrammer üì∏üì± post this location and that‚Äôs definitely the way I like it. #VisitKiso #KisoMe

"Have you ever taken a photo that you can‚Äôt even believe is your own? üò± Like, I look at this and I like it so much that it doesn‚Äôt feel like I took it, no arrogance intended! üòÇ This was one of those rare instances where technical know-how meets total fluke moment in time. This place is in Tsumago, a post town on the Nakasendo route in Kiso Japan. ‚ù§Ô∏èüáØüáµ My guide Taka had told me that morning that he was bringing me to a museum that had great morning light and showed me a photo. I was like üëâüèªüò±üò±. He absolutely didn‚Äôt lie! This effect is the result of low, slat window blinds, smoke from a fire üî• and fall/winter months when the sun is low in the sky. üçÅ‚òÄÔ∏è I was across the other side of the room shooting on a zoom lens to nicely compress the scene and avoid distorted lines on the walls, ceilings and floor. Next minute someone was stoking the fire and I was there and ready. This light makes me drool! ü§§ü§§ü§§ #VisitKiso #KisoMe

"My very first Kiso post, and I shared this image on my story too! This is the result of finding the most delightful autumn scene, and then framing it up with some more autumn goodness üçÅüçÇüçÅüçÇüçÅ. In fact, if you want to see the technique in action my story still has like 12 hours on it! What can I say about Kiso? ‚ù§Ô∏èThe region is surrounded by mountains üèî and was once famous for its production of Japanese cypress üå≤. The main industry now is tourism, and it‚Äôs not hard to see why. It is a very different destination to other places I‚Äôve visited in Japan - very natural, with lots of popular hiking trails, nature and wildlife. At this time of year, with the change of seasons, it is DIVINE! #VisitKiso #KisoMe

"So, the shot I posted yesterday of the Torii Gates at the Nezu Shrine is actually the same location as this shot. In fact, the entrance to the gates are to the left of this image. ‚õ©‚ù§Ô∏èThis is the entrance to the shrine, and to our surprise when we arrived, there was a large group of locals gathering around and stretching. ü§∏üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è At 6:30 AM on the dot ‚è∞üìª the radio started to blare out a fun, upbeat exercise program in Japanese üáØüáµ and all of these people started to stretch and move in unison. üíÉüèΩüï∫üèΩ My biggest pleasure in Tokyo this time around was definitely having the time to explore at my own pace, and the opportunity to discover my own sites. üåè Tokyo is famous for its unique blend of tradition and innovation, and if you look carefully you can see this wherever you go. Within the grounds of the Nezu Shrine we could have been in Tokyo of a hundred years ago, but take one step onto the street and new Tokyo is everywhere. Such an intriguing juxtaposition, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing. üëòüç±üçú @tokyotokyooldmeetsnew #TokyoTokyo

"POSTERIOR CHAIN WORKOUT üòàüôåüèª@coachmarkcarroll took me through this earlier in the week. It‚Äôs a killer!

WORKOUTüëáüèº
-
1Ô∏è‚É£DEFICIT DEADLIFT 4x 6. The deficit allows for greater range of motion. Given the starting position you are in more of a squat and the glutes have a greater stretch. This is a good variation especially for someone who struggles with the initial conventional deadlift leg drive. Really focus on pushing  the ground away and control when lowering the bar to the ground. 3 seconds!
-
2Ô∏è‚É£BB Hip Thrust 4 x 15. Following the deficit deadlift the focus is more directly on glutes with hip thrust. Here the focus is just on top range reps. Notice my reps are quite shallow. These for high reps HURT in a good way! PUMP THEM OUT!
-
3Ô∏è‚É£Lying Leg Curl 1 & 1/4 rep top 4 x 8. After working my posterior chain through hip extension its also important to work knee flexion which also works the hamstrings. Using a 1/4 rep method at the top for a double contraction method.
-
4Ô∏è‚É£Machine Abduction forward lean - 3 x 20. After working both hip extension and knee flexion, to fully work the glutes we also need some abduction work. I love high reps here. 3 sets 20 reps with only 45 seconds rest.
-
5Ô∏è‚É£Walking Lunges - large step glutes emphasis - 2 x 20 each leg. A walking lunge works both quads and glutes but the large step further emphasises the glutes! Body weight reps up and back across the gym. Focus on powerfully driving forward each rep!

"Let‚Äôs talk BALANCE üôåüèª The longer I am in this industry the more I realise the key to long term results is BALANCE! When I first started I was extremely restrictive.
-
No bad foods. No carbs. No days off.
-
However I soon learnt the hard way, that a life that purely revolves around the gym and your body goals leads to a massive imbalance of priorities. Missing out on social event, missing out on birthdays and most of all missing out on foods that I sometimes craved. It also really impacted my health. üòî
.
Each year I devote to fitness and this ‚Äúlife‚Äù I have created through the gym, each year it gets much easier to maintain my body and lifestyle. With it all ultimately coming down to recognising the key is to have a BALANCE of goals in life. A balance between the gym and a social life. And most of all a balance between physical but also mental health! ‚ô•Ô∏è
-
Don‚Äôt be afraid girls of occasionally enjoying foods you enjoy. Yes you can go out and have your favourite dessert. üòçüòç You don‚Äôt have to forever chose ‚Äòchicken & broccoli‚Äô on menus.
-
Don‚Äôt be afraid girls of missing a gym session for a birthday or social event. It‚Äôs not going to derail your progress.

There is nothing better than smashing your goals both IN and OUTSIDE the gym. A balance approach leads to a sustainable result. üîëüíó"

"A Matter Of Focus. 
These two photos show nearly the exact same scene. However, the shift of focus turns them into two different pictures, each telling a unique story. I‚Äôve found that the same principle applies to my life, too. My story is not determined by the circumstances I face, but rather what things and thoughts I focus on in each scene. While auto focus works fine most of the time, some shots require a conscious switch to manual mode. [anzeige/ad] #ManWithAVision #ChopardAlpineEagle @chopard"
"Horse Power.
Horses used to be the ultimate utility vehicle - strong and reliable. But over the past 100 years, needs have grown and technology has evolved. Today, the power of a few hundred horses can be packed into a single car. But what makes a car a great off-road vehicle and useful tool? The answers are currently being built into the all new @ineos_grenadier. [anzeige / ad] Ineos is building the best-in-class off-roader and I‚Äôm privileged to be a part of it. Pictures like these ones from Russia were made possible thanks to a 4x4, therefore I‚Äôm super stoked that Ineos is building the Grenadier - uncompromising and efficient.

"Endless exploration.
Some people think that flying a drone takes away from a hiking experience. Like the instant vision from above would spoiler what‚Äôs around the next bend, making it less exciting.

At this glacier somewhere in southern Russia that was definitely the case."

"¬°Feliz #D√≠aMundialDeLosNi√±os!
Hoy se cumplen 30 a√±os de la Convenci√≥n sobre los Derechos del Ni√±o, un tratado de derechos humanos de las Naciones Unidas que establece los derechos para que los chicos y chicas desarrollen todo su potencial.
Es un orgullo celebrar junto a @UNICEF este d√≠a y apoyar que las voces de los ni√±os, ni√±as y j√≥venes sean escuchadas. Ellos est√°n pidiendo por sus derechos. ¬øQu√© vas a hacer para ayudarlos?

Happy #WorldChildrensDay!
Today marks 30 years of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, a human rights treaty which sets out the rights that must be realized for children to develop to their full potential. 
I‚Äôm proud to celebrate with @UNICEF and support young voices to speak up with pride.
Children are demanding their rights. What will you do?

"#Regram #RG @guardian:
The European parliament has declared a global ‚Äúclimate and environmental emergency‚Äù ahead of the latest UN global crisis summit. 
The vote came as scientists warned that the world may have already crossed a series of climate tipping points. 
In a separate vote on Thursday, MEPs backed a resolution stating that current EU climate targets were ‚Äúnot in line‚Äù with the 2015 Paris climate agreement and backed a tougher target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. While this is an improvement on the current 40% target, environmental campaigners said the EU's declaration wasn't backed by sufficient action. 
The Brexit party voted against both climate resolutions. . . . . . .

In the past decade, climate-fueled disasters have forced about 20 million people a year to leave their homes ‚Äî equivalent to one every two seconds ‚Äî according to a new report from Oxfam. People are seven times more likely to be displaced by floods, cyclones and wildfires than volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, and three times more likely than by conflict, according to the report released Monday. Oxfam, a nonprofit that is working to end poverty, is calling on world leaders to reduce emissions as fast as possible, and asking the international community to do more to fund recovery programs for poorer countries affected by the climate emergency.

"#Regram #RG @wmo_omm: Levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached a new record high. This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems.

Today we released the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin which showed that globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 407.8 parts per million in 2018, up from 405.5 parts per million in 2017."
At this time of crisis for the Amazon, I support the people of Brazil working to save their natural and cultural heritage. They are an amazing, moving and humbling example of the commitment and passion needed to save the environment. The future of these irreplaceable ecosystems is at stake and I am proud to stand with the groups protecting them. While worthy of support, we did not fund the organizations targeted. I remain committed to supporting the Brazilian indigenous communities, local governments, scientists, educators and general public who are working tirelessly to secure the Amazon for the future of all Brazilians.

The amount of land affected by an oil spill in North Dakota is almost 10 times larger than initially reported, officials say. TC Energy, the company that owns the Keystone 1 Pipeline, shut it down on October 29 after discovering more than 383,000 gallons of oil had leaked from the pipe into surrounding wetlands. Initial reports from TC Energy and and North Dakota‚Äôs Department of Environmental Quality estimated about 2,500 square yards of land were affected ‚Äî now they say it‚Äôs more than 23,000 square yards.

One year to the day and the life support machinery jolting your body still claims a part of my mind. The memory boils. The pumps, hoses, and beeps were your perpetrators, the religious trauma and unescapable self attrition, robbing your body of its autonomy. My most primitive thoughts were to dive through the ICU window, beat the fuck out of the doctors and carry you on my back to safety. But we couldn‚Äôt run this time. And who am I kidding, you were always stronger than me anyway. I‚Äôll imagine you carried me out on your back. Cause I needed it.  And most of the time we were there when we needed it.
